# Problem 1: Product Sense - Reels Session Duration Analysis
**Time Limit: 8 minutes**

## Scenario
The Reels PM approaches you with concern: "Our average session duration dropped 15% last month, from 8.2 minutes to 7.0 minutes. Users are still opening Reels, but they're not staying as long. We need to understand why this happened and what we can do about it."

## Your Task

### Part A: Metric Investigation (3 minutes)
**Question**: What are the 3 most important metrics you'd investigate first to understand the session duration drop?

*Hint: Think about the user journey and different ways engagement can break down*

### Part B: Root Cause Hypotheses (3 minutes)  
**Question**: What are 2-3 potential root causes for declining session duration? Explain your reasoning.

*Hint: Consider product changes, content quality, technical issues, and external factors*

### Part C: A/B Test Design (2 minutes)
**Question**: Design an A/B test to improve session duration. What specific change would you test and what metrics would you measure?

*Hint: Focus on one actionable intervention*

## Follow-up Questions
Be prepared to answer:
- How would you prioritize which hypothesis to test first?
- What external data sources would help validate your hypotheses?
- How would you segment users to understand if the drop affects everyone equally?

## Success Criteria
- **Clear metric prioritization** with business justification
- **Specific, testable hypotheses** with logical reasoning  
- **Well-designed experiment** with clear success metrics
- **Data-driven approach** throughout your reasoning

## Meta Context
- Reels competes with TikTok for short-form video engagement
- Session duration directly impacts ad revenue and creator monetization
- Meta typically runs hundreds of concurrent A/B tests
- Speed of insight matters for competitive advantage

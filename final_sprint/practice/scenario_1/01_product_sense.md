**Question**: What are the 3 most critical metrics you'd analyze to understand this DAU/MAU decline?

*Hint: Think about the full user journey from acquisition to retention*

### Part B: Root Cause Hypotheses (3 minutes)  
**Question**: What are 3 potential reasons for declining user stickiness? Rank them by likelihood and explain your reasoning.

*Hint: Consider product changes, competitive dynamics, user lifecycle changes, and technical factors*

### Part C: Recovery Strategy (2 minutes)
**Question**: Design a 3-month plan to improve DAU/MAU back to 0.65. What would be your key initiatives and success metrics?

*Hint: Focus on actionable interventions with measurable outcomes*

## Follow-up Questions
Be prepared to discuss:
- How would you segment users to understand which cohorts are most affected?
- What leading indicators would predict DAU/MAU changes before they happen?
- How would you balance new user acquisition vs existing user retention?
- What competitive intelligence would inform your strategy?

**Time Limit: 8 minutes**

## Scenario

Key issues:
- 30% of conversions lack clear attribution path
- Cross-device tracking gaps affecting measurement
- iOS 14.5+ privacy changes impacting data quality
- Advertisers demanding more transparent ROI reporting

## Your Task

*Hint: Consider the full customer journey from ad impression to conversion*

### Part B: Root Cause Investigation (3 minutes)  
**Question**: What are 3 likely causes of the attribution gaps? Rank by business impact and explain your reasoning.

*Hint: Consider technical limitations, privacy changes, user behavior, and measurement methodology*

### Part C: Solution Strategy (2 minutes)
**Question**: Design a 6-month roadmap to improve attribution accuracy from 70% to 85%. What would be your key initiatives?

## Follow-up Questions
Be prepared to discuss:
- How would you handle iOS privacy changes and signal loss?

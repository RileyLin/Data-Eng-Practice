## 1 What does data engineering mean to you?

**Core script**

> Situation – In group‑life & disability insurance, I inherited dozens of siloed schemas: Salesforce, a new quoting engine, and legacy claims data, with no clear path to a unified view.
> 
> 
> **Task** – My charter was to turn that sprawl into a single source of truth so underwriters and product managers could act in hours, not weeks. This involved navigating significant ambiguity in requirements and data structures.
> 
> **Action** – I treat **data engineering as the craft of converting messy, high‑entropy events into trustworthy, self‑service building blocks**. Concretely, I:
> 
> • designed a Snowflake‑based lakehouse with dbt‑modelled "gold" marts, a solution that became a blueprint for two other analytics teams, reducing their new data source integration time by 40%.
> 
> • enforced contract tests + Great Expectations to guarantee 0 critical data quality regressions,
> 
> • published lineage in Catalog so analysts could discover and remix without tickets.
> 
> **Result** – Quoting latency dropped from 3 days to 30 minutes, driving a *17 % lift in same‑week quote conversions*.
> 
> **Why it matters** – That's the lever: data pipelines only matter when they **unblock decisions and unlock product innovation** across the organization. 
> 
> enable data to drive real world decisions and pull levers in the real world
> 

**Signals surfaced** – *Motivation (org-level impact), Proactive (blueprint adoption), Unstructured‑env ownership (ambiguity, siloed systems), Communication, Perseverance (implied by complexity), Growth (learning and applying).*

**Likely follow‑ups & pocket responses**

| Interviewer follow‑up | 15‑second response |
| --- | --- |
| "How did you measure 'trustworthy'?" | Tracked "freshness × completeness" SLA: F ≤ 60 min lag, C = 100 % of required fields non‑null. Pipeline alerts paged me on breach; red → 5 Why's to root cause. |
| "Biggest obstacle?" | Conflicting data‑owner priorities for three key departments. I set up weekly office hours, mapped each team's goals to shared KPIs (e.g., time-to-insight), and won consensus by demonstrating how better lineage and a central model reduced their individual bug tickets and ad-hoc reporting load by ~20%. (*Conflict‑Resolution, Empathy, Perseverance*) |
| "What would you improve?" | Schema‑evolve testing earlier in CI. I'm piloting contract‑driven development so producers can't break consumers—one PR, one mock test. This was a learning from a minor issue in a related project. (*Growth*) |

## 2 Tell me about using data to make an impact or convince others

**Core script**

> S – Sales leadership suspected we'd miss Q3 premium targets but lacked granular insight and there were differing opinions on the root cause across regional VPs.
> 
> 
> **T** – Build a real‑time goal‑tracking dashboard that let VPs drill by segment, benchmark vs. competitors, and provide a common factual basis for strategy.
> 
> **A** – I merged Salesforce opportunity, market‑share from S&P, and third‑party rate filings. This required resolving initial data discrepancies in the S&P feed which took several days of focused effort. Using cohort retention curves, I highlighted that mid‑market brokers were under‑performing by ‑12 pp. I narrated the story in a live exec readout. One VP was initially skeptical about the proposed broker-spiff pilot, concerned about margin erosion. I addressed this by presenting a sensitivity analysis showing breakeven points and upside potential, which secured their buy-in for the pilot.
> 
> **R** – The pilot shifted focus to mid‑market, lifting closed‑won in that segment by 9 %, enough to beat Q3 targets by $3.1 M.
> 

**Signals** – *Motivation (Impact‑orientation), Communication, Proactive, Unstructured‑env, Conflict-Resolution, Empathy, Perseverance.*

**Likely follow‑ups**

| Q | A |
| --- | --- |
| "What analytics method convinced them?" | A/B‑style counter‑factual: projected vs. actual after spiff; p‑value = 0.03, visualized with cumulative win curves. Clear, impactful visualization was key. |
| "How did you handle skeptical VPs?" | Beyond the specific example, my general approach is a pre‑read memo with assumptions + sensitivity tables; I invite them to pressure‑test in session—turning potential confrontation into co‑creation and shared understanding. (*Conflict‑Resolution, Empathy*) |
| "Any data quality challenges merging sources?" | Yes, the third-party rate filings were initially inconsistent. I built a validation script and worked with the vendor over a week to establish a cleaner data feed, which was crucial for the benchmark's accuracy. (*Perseverance, Growth*) |

## 3 Describe a project you led and its impact

**Core script**

> S – We decided to move the entire company to Salesforce while retiring a 15‑year AS/400 policy admin. Reporting for multiple departments would break during the cut‑over if not managed proactively.
> 
> 
> **T** – Lead the data‑reporting continuity work‑stream: 4 analysts, 2 engineers, 8 functional stakeholders across Sales, Finance, and Ops. This was a high-stakes project with tight deadlines.
> 
> **A** – Drafted a migration map: dual‑write CDC → interim views in Snowflake → phased dashboard switchover. For ambiguity (field mismatches, missing IDs, conflicting business logic from different departments), I ran a weekly "data triage" guild. In one instance, Sales and Finance had different definitions for 'booked revenue'. I facilitated a session where we mapped both needs and designed an interim model that could serve both, preventing a major reporting divergence. This alignment was key.
> 
> **R** – Zero report downtime; finance closed books on time; post‑launch survey showed +23 NPS from sales leaders on data trust. The model developed also accelerated new product reporting by 2 weeks.
> 

**Signals** – *Leadership (cross-functional team), Proactive, Unstructured‑env (ambiguity, system retirement), Perseverance (high-stakes, tight deadline), Communication, Conflict-Resolution (booked revenue definition), Empathy (understanding different dept. needs).*

**Follow‑ups**

| Q | A |
| --- | --- |
| "Biggest conflict beyond that?" | Finance needed monthly granularity for regulatory reports; engineering wanted to defer due to complexity. I facilitated a white‑board session, translated financial risk (potential fines) into dev‑days avoided by doing it right the first time, and we landed on a lean, phased slice that met immediate regulatory needs and deferred non-critical aspects. (*Conflict-Resolution, Empathy, Communication*) |
| "If you could redo?" | Begin automated reconciliation testing between AS/400 and Salesforce staging data much sooner—caught a 0.7 % currency rounding issue affecting international policies late in UAT, causing a scramble. Earlier detection would have saved stress. (*Growth*) |
| "Biggest lesson from leading this?" | Establishing a clear RACI matrix and communication plan upfront for such a diverse stakeholder group is paramount. We had a minor early slip where a downstream team wasn't informed of a schema tweak, causing brief confusion. We course-corrected with a daily digest and a clear point-of-contact, which smoothed things significantly. (*Growth, Communication*) |

## 4 How do you plan to succeed at Meta?

**Core script**

> My plan has a few pillars:
> • **Learn & Contribute Quickly:** Lean into Bootcamp – Use it as user‑research: ship small diffs in 3 codebases to learn Meta infra & culture. I aim to understand the 'why' behind current systems. *(Growth, Motivation)*
> • **Drive Impact:** Pick the highest‑leverage pain – I'll interview PMs & DSs across related teams, find the data gap that blocks critical decisions or product velocity, and deliver a thin‑slice pipeline or solution within my first couple of cycles. *(Proactive, Unstructured-env ownership, Motivation)*
> • **Build a Feedback Flywheel:** 30/60/90‑day written goals, weekly sync with manager, proactively seek peer feedback, and ask for brutal candor à la "Meta Performance Framework." I see feedback as a gift. *(Growth, Communication)*
> • **Foster Collaboration & Community:** Send PRs to data‑infra docs that confused me; keeps the ladder behind me sturdy. Invest in relationships – Coffee‑chat XFN partners; I've shipped fastest when Eng + Product + DS debate around the same Figma or design doc. I believe in challenging ideas respectfully to get to the best outcome. *(Empathy, potential for Conflict-Resolution done well, Communication)*
> • **Embrace Challenges:** I anticipate challenges, especially with data scale or novel problem spaces at Meta. I'm prepared to iterate, seek mentorship, and persistently work through blockers, seeing them as opportunities to learn and innovate. *(Perseverance, Growth)*
>

**Signals** – *Motivation, Proactive, Growth, Communication, Able‑to‑work‑unstructured, Empathy, Perseverance, (Constructive) Conflict-Resolution.*

**Follow‑ups**

| Q | A |
| --- | --- |
| "Which team excites you?" | Anything in Biz‑Messaging or Ads‑Infra where petabyte‑scale event streams meet monetization levers—sweet spot for my dbt/Snowflake lineage focus and interest in real-time decisioning systems. I'm keen to understand how Meta tackles X challenge at scale. |
| "What if priorities shift dramatically?" | Default‑alive: always aim to ship in <12‑week slices so pivots cost ≤1 sprint. If a big shift happens, I'd first ensure I understand the new strategic direction, then conduct a rapid retrospective on current work, identify reusable components, and re‑rank priorities with my lead using a framework like ICE (Impact, Confidence, Effort), communicating clearly with any affected stakeholders. (*Able-to-work-unstructured, Communication, Proactive*) |

## 5 How do you prioritize competing tasks?

**Core script**

> I combine RICE for roadmap items and an Eisenhower matrix for interrupts, but critically, I ensure this is a transparent and collaborative process:
>
> • **RICE** (Reach × Impact × Confidence ÷ Effort) helps rank larger projects or features weekly with my team and lead. Anything with a low score or that drops significantly gets re-evaluated.
>
> • Daily, I map incoming tasks and my own to-dos into an Eisenhower matrix: Do, Schedule, Delegate, Delete.
>
> • **Transparency & Alignment:** I surface these trade‑offs and my proposed priorities in a living Notion doc or team channel, reviewed in stand‑up or planning. This ensures stakeholders understand the 'why' behind sequencing and provides a forum to discuss any concerns or new information, fostering buy-in even when their preferred task isn't P0.
>
> **Example** – During the Salesforce cut‑over, an urgent request came from marketing for a new audience segment list (Important, Not Urgent). Simultaneously, new critical blockers emerged for the core migration reconciliation tool (Important, Urgent). I communicated to marketing the delay, explaining the critical system-wide impact of the reconciliation tool (preventing a potential $200K billing slip). I time-boxed an hour to guide a junior analyst on how they could self-serve a simplified version of the marketing list, thus delegating and still providing partial value. The main reconciliation tool was shipped on time.
>

**Signals** – *Proactive, Communication, Able‑to‑work‑unstructured, Growth (from using a system), Empathy (understanding stakeholder needs), Conflict Resolution (managing expectations and finding partial solutions).*

**Follow‑ups**

| Q | A |
| --- | --- |
| "What if everything scores high / multiple urgent tasks?" | Force‑rank by marginal impact per sprint and direct impact on overarching team/org goals. I'd challenge assumptions with leadership if needed—if everything is P0, nothing is. This involves clear communication about what *won't* get done and why. (*Conflict-Resolution, Communication*) |
| "Tools?" | Jira/Linear for ticketing and effort tracking, dbt‑docs for lineage dependencies, Confluence/Notion for decision logs, and a Looker burn‑down chart so execs and stakeholders see impact vs. scope creep. |

## 6 Tell me about a time you were wrong

**Core script**

> S – Early in a project to optimize our recommendation engine's data pipeline, I approved a schema change removing a nullable `user_region_preference` field, assuming it was redundant with a newer geo-IP derived field. It passed unit tests but broke downstream revenue attribution for a small but high-value segment of users who had explicitly set preferences, temporarily hiding ~$1M in annualized attributed premium for 48h before detection.
>
> **T** – Own the failure, restore trust with Product and Finance, and harden the process to prevent recurrence across any similar pipelines.
>
> **A** – Immediately reverted the migration. I personally joined Finance's and Product's team syncs to apologize for the disruption and explain the root cause. I published a detailed RCA within 24h, outlining the flawed assumption and lack of specific test coverage. Systemically, I implemented stricter contract tests between data layers, added specific canary tests for critical segmentation fields, and proposed a "data consumer review" step for schema changes affecting Tier-1 datasets, which the team adopted.
>
> **R** – No financial restatement was needed due to the quick revert. Finance and Product thanked engineering for transparency and the robust preventative measures. Error rate on schema migrations related to user segmentation dropped from an estimated 3% to effectively 0% over the next two quarters.
>

**Signals** – *Growth (learning from mistake, systemic fixes), Perseverance (RCA, implementing changes), Empathy (apologizing, understanding impact), Communication (RCA, team syncs), Proactive (proposing new review step).*

**Follow‑ups**

| Q | A |
| --- | --- |
| "Push‑back from peers on the new review step?" | Some felt the 'data consumer review' could slow velocity. I acknowledged the concern and ran a 2‑week trial on non-critical changes, demonstrating it added minimal overhead (avg. <2 hours delay) but significantly improved stakeholder confidence and caught two potential downstream issues. The team then agreed to adopt it for Tier-1 datasets. (*Conflict‑Resolution, Empathy, Communication, Perseverance*) |
| "Personal takeaway?" | Beyond the technical fix, my biggest takeaway was that assumptions about data usage, especially across different domains (like product features vs. financial attribution), need explicit validation with consumers. Early, candid visibility and cross-functional discussion beats silent assumptions. I now actively schedule "pre‑mortems" or quick syncs on any migration with ≥ 3-5 downstream consumers or cross-domain impact. (*Growth, Proactive*) |

### Quick rehearsal tips

1. **Tailor scope to IC level** – Emphasize org‑level impact, cross‑team coordination, and proactive leadership to hit Meta's IC5/IC6 signals.
2. **Proof‑points** – Quantify results (%, $, minutes, number of teams impacted).
3. **STAR Method & Active Voice** – Use Situation, Task, Action, Result. Use "I" statements. Interviewers evaluate *clarity* as part of Communication.
4. **Signal Richness** - Aim to weave in multiple positive signals into each story naturally. The follow-ups are your chance to elaborate on signals less prominent in the main story.

Nail these, and you'll emit the right eight signals every time. Good luck—you've got this!

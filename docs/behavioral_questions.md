## 2 / “Tell Me About Yourself” (\~ 2 min)

> **“Hi, I’m Riley Lin — an analytics‑minded data engineer who loves turning raw data into reliable, self‑serve products that guide decisions.**
>
> **Background.** At **Symetra Financial** I split my time between hands‑on engineering (Snowflake + dbt, SQL, Python) and leading small pods to deliver BI products for underwriting and sales. Earlier rotations in actuarial analytics taught me to speak business as well as tech.
>
> **Impact highlights.** *First,* I merged three siloed policy systems into a Book‑of‑Business model that cut report latency from 7 days to 2 hours and unlocked a retention play worth **\$1.2 M**. *More recently,* I led a two‑analyst team to build a **SalesMart** quoting dashboard—now a top‑3 asset company‑wide—and surfaced funnel drop‑offs projected to add **\$1.5 M** in premium.
>
> **Looking ahead.** “Looking ahead, I’m eager to tackle data problems whose scale—billions of users and petabytes of events—demands world‑class engineering, and to be at the forefront of applying and shaping Gen AI tools that turn that data into new product experiences. Meta’s investment in both scale and AI experimentation makes it the ideal place for that next chapter.”

## 3 / Most‑Impactful Project — **SalesMart Quoting Dashboard** (STAR, \~ 2 min)

> **Context** – Sales execs could see revenue booked but lacked visibility into the **quote‑to‑bind funnel**: no close‑ratio, no time‑to‑price, no churn insight. Data lived in 10 siloed reports.
> **Task** – As project lead and data engineer, deliver a unified SalesMart + one‑stop dashboard within 12 months.
> **Actions** –
> • Led a pod of **2 analysts**; ran bi‑weekly backlog reviews with Sales, Finance, Product to lock metric definitions.
> • Modelled a Snowflake **SalesMart** (fact + 5 dims) plus a **daily snapshot** table for trend analysis; dbt pipelines with Great Expectations tests.
> • Replaced 10 legacy reports by launching a Power BI “Quote‑to‑Bind” dashboard with drill‑downs for region, broker, and product.
> **Results** – Refresh time **2‑3 h → 15 min**; report count **10 → 1**; became a **top‑3 most‑used dashboard** (120 WAUs). Trend view exposed a 6 % quote‑to‑price drop‑off; fix is projected to lift annual premium **\$1.5 M**.
> **Reflection** – Investing early in shared metric definitions and a snapshot layer turned BI from reactive to proactive insight—a lesson I now apply to every project.

---

## 4 / Conflict & Influence Story — **Census Data Pipeline** (STAR, \~ 1 ½ min)

> **Context** – Census files (age, salary, dependents) are critical for pricing group policies, yet no team owned ingestion. Sales, Finance, Underwriting all needed the data but Engineering had **zero bandwidth**.
> **Task** – Enable reliable, timely census data without formal authority or budget.
> **Actions** –
> • Spent two evenings mirroring an existing payroll ETL to land a **200 k‑row** census file in Snowflake—**live POC**.
> • Built a one‑slide ROI model showing **\$800 k** annual premium lift from improved pricing accuracy.
> • Demoed the POC to stakeholders; the live refresh cut model run‑time from 7 days to 10 min, which persuaded the Eng manager to allocate one sprint.
> **Result** – Productionised daily census ingest in **3 months**; actuaries refresh risk models on demand, and Sales quotes two weeks faster, contributing **\$1 M** added premium last year.
> **Reflection** – Influence comes from *evidence plus experience*: a working prototype + quantified upside turns “nice‑to‑have” into a funded priority.

**How to use this sheet**

* Start with the TMAY to set the narrative.
* Use the **SalesMart** STAR as your flagship “impact” story.
* Keep the **Census pipeline** handy for conflict / influence questions.
* Reference the matrix if the interviewer asks for other examples (e.g., failure = Commission RCA).

Rehearse each section aloud until the flow feels natural—then you’ll have crisp, metric‑backed answers ready for whatever prompt comes your way.

# How to Use These Examples for Your Meta Behavioral Interview

This guide is designed to help you leverage your own experiences to craft compelling narratives for your Meta behavioral interviews. Meta interviewers assess candidates against a "Leadership & Execution" rubric. The stories below are tailored to highlight these qualities.

**Meta's Leadership & Execution Rubric (Simplified):**

*   **Ownership & Drive:** Acts like an owner, demonstrates initiative, scales their impact, perseveres through challenges.
*   **People Growth:** Uplifts others, shares knowledge, mentors, helps colleagues develop.
*   **Craft Excellence:** Raises the bar for quality and rigor, demonstrates deep expertise, drives strategic value.
*   **Communication & Influence:** Thrives in ambiguity, aligns stakeholders, communicates clearly, influences outcomes (with or without authority).

**Your Goal:** For each behavioral question, tell a concise story using the **STAR method** that showcases multiple positive signals from this rubric.

## The STAR Method: Structure Your Stories

*   **S (Situation):** Briefly set the context. What was the project or challenge?
*   **T (Task):** What was your specific responsibility or goal?
*   **A (Action):** What specific steps did *you* take? Focus on your contributions. Use "I" statements.
*   **R (Result):** What was the outcome? Quantify it whenever possible (%, $, time saved, impact). What did you learn?

## Preparing Your Stories:

1.  **"One-Pager" Templates (as exemplified below):** Each answer in this guide follows a STAR format. Think of each as a "one-pager" for that story.
2.  **"Root-cause → Insight" Follow-ups:** After your main STAR answer, interviewers will dig deeper. Each story below includes potential follow-up questions with brief, insightful answers. Prepare your own for other scenarios. Consider:
    *   "Why did you choose that specific KPI/approach?"
    *   "What didn't go well, and how did you adapt?"
    *   "What was the biggest challenge?"
    *   "What would you do differently next time?"
    *   "How did you handle disagreement or conflicting priorities?"
3.  **The ROAR Delivery Loop (Practice Method):**
    *   **R**ecall: Glance at your story outline.
    *   **O**rate: Tell the story aloud (aim for ≤ 2 minutes for the main story).
    *   **A**ssess: Record yourself. Score for clarity, metrics, and reflection.
    *   **R**efine: Tweak phrasing, cut filler, re-record. Repeat until smooth.
4.  **"Mix-and-Match" Matrix:** Create a quick table mapping common question themes to your primary and backup stories. This helps you adapt if questions are phrased unexpectedly.

    | Question Theme             | Primary Story                               | Backup Story                                 |
    | :------------------------- | :------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------- |
    | Ownership / Initiative     | Internship Program                          | GenAI Automation                             |
    | Impact / Convincing Others | GenAI Automation                            | Census Ingestion Influence                   |
    | Leadership                 | Salesforce Migration                        | Internship Program                           |
    | Mentorship / People Growth | Technical Onboarding                        | Internship Program (mentoring aspect)        |
    | Craft Excellence / Quality | Book-of-Business / Power BI / Census Tech | GenAI (technical build)                    |
    | Ambiguity / Influence      | Census Ingestion Influence                  | Salesforce Migration (stakeholder alignment) |
    | Problem Solving            | Power BI Optimization                       | Commission Error RCA                         |
    | Failure / Learning         | Commission Error                            | A challenge from Salesforce Migration        |

5.  **Practice with Lightning Prompts:** Use ChatGPT or a friend to fire random behavioral prompts and practice delivering your STAR answer within two minutes.
6.  **Day-of-Interview Cheat Code:** Before each interview, jot down on your notepad:
    *   The core Goal/Signal/Metric/Target (GSM-T) of a key project you might reference.
    *   2-3 key numbers/quantifiable results you *must* mention.
    *   1 crucial "lesson learned" to showcase reflection.

## 1 What does data engineering mean to you?

**Core script**

> **S (Situation):** In my previous role, our group-life and disability insurance division was grappling with fragmented data. We had siloed schemas across Salesforce, a new quoting engine, and a legacy claims system. This made it incredibly difficult for underwriters and product managers to get a unified view for timely decision-making. For example, our "Book-of-Business" report was manually intensive and lacked the granularity to show historical premium trends by key segments like product, region, or broker.
>
> **T (Task):** My charter was to transform this data sprawl into a single source of truth. The goal was to empower our business users to act on insights in hours, not weeks, and to provide a level of analytical detail that was previously impossible. This involved navigating significant ambiguity in both requirements and the existing data structures.
>
> **A (Action):** I believe **data engineering is the craft of converting messy, high-entropy raw data into trustworthy, accessible, and self-service building blocks that drive tangible business outcomes.** It's about building robust pipelines, but more importantly, enabling the organization to leverage its data strategically. Concretely, in the Book-of-Business revamp, I:
>
> *   Re-architected the underlying data model in Snowflake, creating new tables to capture exact premium history at a granular level, connecting historical quotes to member-level details for the first time through the Census Ingestion project I later spearheaded.
> *   Developed new dbt models to transform and aggregate this data, ensuring historical accuracy and consistency.
> *   Collaborated with business analysts to redefine the report's KPIs and visualizations in Power BI, directly addressing their analytical pain points.
> *   Implemented data quality checks using Great Expectations within the pipeline to ensure the accuracy of the new, complex calculations.
>
> **R (Result):** The revamped Book-of-Business report, powered by this new data foundation, unlocked trend analysis that previously required weeks of ad-hoc querying. Underwriters could now analyze profitability by specific products and regions, and broker relationship managers could identify growth opportunities more effectively. This project, along with others like the Census Ingestion, reinforced my view that data engineering's true value lies in **unlocking decisions and product innovation** by making complex data reliable and usable.

**Signals surfaced** – *Craft Excellence (re-architecture, dbt, Snowflake, data quality), Motivation (org-level impact, enabling users), Unstructured‑env ownership (ambiguity, siloed systems), Communication (collaboration with analysts).*

**Likely follow‑ups & pocket responses**

| Interviewer follow‑up                                     | 15‑second response                                                                                                                                                              |
| :-------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| "How did you measure 'trustworthy' for that new report?"  | "We defined 'trustworthy' by a combination of data accuracy, validated against source systems, and report uptime/freshness. Accuracy was ensured by automated reconciliation tests within dbt against financial ledgers, and we aimed for 99.9% data freshness, updated within 4 hours of source data changes." |
| "What was the biggest obstacle in that BoB revamp?"       | "The primary obstacle was defining the exact historical logic for premium allocation, as documentation was sparse. I organized workshops with senior underwriters and finance SMEs to reconstruct the business rules, which was crucial for the model's accuracy." (*Perseverance, Collaboration*) |
| "Beyond that project, what's a key principle you follow?" | "Data utility over perfection. While rigor is essential, I prioritize delivering value incrementally. I'd rather provide 80% of the needed data reliably and quickly, then iterate, than wait months for a 'perfect' solution that misses the window of opportunity for business impact." |

## 2 Tell me about using data to make an impact or convince others

**Core script**

> **S (Situation):** Our claims department faced a significant bottleneck in determining eligibility for certain policy types. The process involved manually reviewing lengthy policy documents to extract specific clauses and conditions, which was time-consuming (often 2-3 hours per complex case) and prone to inconsistencies.
>
> **T (Task):** I saw an opportunity to leverage generative AI to automate this extraction process. My goal was to build and productionize a custom GPT-based solution that could accurately identify and extract the relevant policy information, drastically reducing manual effort and improving consistency. The challenge was not just technical, but also convincing stakeholders of the reliability and security of using a new technology like GenAI for a critical business process.
>
> **A (Action):**
> 1.  **Proof of Concept & Iteration:** I started by building a proof-of-concept using a selection of anonymized policy documents and OpenAI's API. I developed a series of targeted prompts and fine-tuned a model to accurately extract key data points like coverage limits, exclusion clauses, and effective dates.
> 2.  **Stakeholder Engagement & Buy-in:** I proactively scheduled demos with claims managers and legal SMEs. I presented the PoC's accuracy metrics (e.g., 95% accuracy on key field extraction compared to manual review in initial tests) and a clear workflow for human oversight and validation. I addressed their concerns about data privacy by proposing a solution that would run in a secure environment and only process anonymized text snippets where possible.
> 3.  **Productionization & Enablement:** Once I got their buy-in for a pilot, I productionized the solution. This involved creating a simple UI for claims adjusters to upload documents and receive structured output. Critically, I created reusable prompts, templates, and a short training guide. I also ran brown-bag sessions to educate and empower claims team members to use the tool effectively and even suggest improvements.
> 4.  **Scaling the Impact:** After the initial success in claims, I socialized these wins more broadly. I demonstrated the core technology and reusable components to other departments (e.g., underwriting, customer service) and helped them identify manual text-processing workflows where similar solutions could be applied, providing templates and guidance.
>
> **R (Result):**
> *   The custom GPT solution cut the manual workflow for policy document extraction in the claims department by approximately 90%, reducing average handling time from hours to under 15 minutes per case.
> *   Accuracy and consistency improved, as measured by a 50% reduction in identified errors during downstream quality checks.
> *   The successful pilot and subsequent broader socialization led to three other business areas adopting similar GenAI tools for their own text-based workflows, all built using the foundational prompts and templates I developed, without requiring significant new engineering resources. This demonstrated the scalability of the solution.
> *   This initiative not only drove significant efficiency but also convinced initially skeptical stakeholders about the practical, secure application of generative AI to solve real business problems.
>

**Signals** – *Ownership & Drive (proactive initiative, end-to-end solution), Craft Excellence (GenAI, productionization), Communication & Influence (demos, addressing concerns, training, socializing wins), Motivation (solving real business problems, scaling impact), Unstructured-env (new tech application).*

**Likely follow‑ups**

| Q                                                                 | A                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| :---------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "How did you measure the 90% workflow reduction?"                 | "We conducted a time study. Before implementation, we logged the average time claims adjusters spent on manual document review for a sample of 50 complex cases. After the tool was rolled out, we tracked the time for the same type of cases using the tool, including any necessary human validation. The 90% figure represents the average reduction in active processing time per case." |
| "What was the biggest hurdle in getting stakeholder buy-in?"      | "The primary hurdle was concerns around the 'black box' nature of GenAI and data security. I addressed this by emphasizing the human-in-the-loop design for validation, showing high accuracy on their specific documents in the PoC, and detailing the secure processing environment. Transparency about limitations and a phased rollout were key." (*Communication, Empathy*) |
| "How did you ensure the GenAI tool remained accurate over time?"    | "We implemented a feedback loop. Adjusters could flag any inaccurate extractions. These were reviewed monthly to identify patterns, and I would then refine the prompts or underlying model parameters as needed. We also planned for periodic retraining with new policy document examples to counter model drift." (*Continuous Improvement, Technical Rigor*) |
| "You mentioned socializings wins. How did that lead to adoption?" | "I didn't just send an email. I ran interactive demos tailored to each department's potential use cases, provided very simple 'quick start' templates, and offered 1:1 support to help them get their first small win with the tech. Making it easy to try and succeed was crucial for organic adoption." (*Enablement, Proactive*) |

## 3 Describe a project you led and its impact

**Core script**

> **S (Situation):** Our company made a strategic decision to modernize its sales operations by migrating from a 15-year-old legacy AS/400-based quote tracking system to Salesforce Sales Cloud. This was a complex undertaking, as the legacy system was deeply embedded, and numerous critical KPI dashboards for sales leadership and underwriting relied on its data. My role was to lead the data strategy and reporting continuity workstream.
>
> **T (Task):** I was tasked with ensuring a seamless transition with zero interruption to critical business reporting. This involved designing an interim data architecture to bridge the gap during the phased rollout, architecting a new sales data mart optimized for Salesforce data, and critically, aligning sales leadership, underwriting, and software engineering teams around a unified rollout plan and data model.
>
> **A (Action):**
> 1.  **Architecture & Design:** I began by thoroughly analyzing the existing data flows and reporting requirements. I designed an interim data architecture that utilized a dual-write strategy with Change Data Capture (CDC) from the AS/400 system into a staging area in Snowflake. From there, I created interim views that mirrored the structure of the old system's data, allowing existing KPI dashboards (primarily in Looker) to continue functioning with minimal changes during the initial phases of the cut-over. Simultaneously, I designed the new sales data mart architecture in Snowflake, leveraging dbt for modeling. This new mart was designed to be scalable, align with Salesforce's object model, and incorporate new dimensions and metrics requested by sales leadership.
> 2.  **Stakeholder Alignment:** This was a critical and challenging aspect. Sales leadership was focused on new CRM functionalities, underwriting had specific data integrity concerns for risk assessment, and engineering was managing the core Salesforce implementation and data migration. I established a cross-functional "Data Council" with representatives from each group, meeting bi-weekly.
>     *   To address conflicting priorities for the new sales mart, I facilitated several whiteboarding sessions, mapping each team's critical data needs and KPIs. We identified overlaps and negotiated trade-offs. For instance, underwriting required very granular historical quote versioning that wasn't a native Salesforce feature. We designed a custom object and flow in Salesforce, and a corresponding detailed model in the new data mart to capture this, satisfying their needs without overly complicating the core sales user experience.
>     *   I developed a phased rollout plan for the dashboards, clearly communicating which dashboards would switch to the interim views and when, and later, to the new sales mart. This was visualized with a clear timeline and RAG status shared weekly.
> 3.  **Execution & Rollout:** I worked closely with the software engineering team on the CDC pipeline implementation and the Salesforce data migration strategy. I led a small team of data analysts to build and test the dbt models for both the interim views and the new sales mart. We conducted rigorous UAT with sales ops and underwriting power users for each dashboard before switching it over.
>
> **R (Result):**

**Follow‑ups**

| Q | A |
| --- | --- |
| "What was the biggest technical challenge in designing the interim architecture?" | "The main challenge was handling data transformations and maintaining referential integrity in real-time between the AS/400's EBCDIC character set and denormalized tables, and Snowflake's UTF-8 and relational structure, while ensuring the interim views matched the legacy system's output exactly. We used a combination of a robust CDC tool with custom transformation scripts and rigorous data validation checksums at each step of the interim pipeline to ensure data fidelity for the live dashboards." (*Technical Depth, Problem Solving*) |
| "How did you convince a skeptical stakeholder during the alignment phase, for example, about a specific data model decision?" | "One of the underwriting leads was initially hesitant about our proposed simplified staging model for policy attributes, fearing loss of granularity needed for their risk models. I scheduled a dedicated session, walked them through how the new sales mart would capture all their required detail using a star schema linked to the Salesforce custom objects, and importantly, demonstrated with a prototype dbt model and sample Looker dashboard how they could access even more nuanced data than before. Seeing the tangible benefit and how their core needs were addressed directly built their confidence and secured their buy-in." (*Communication, Empathy, Influence, Technical Demonstration*) |
| "If you could redo one part of this migration project, what would it be?" | "I would have pushed for even earlier and more comprehensive automated data reconciliation testing between the AS/400 source and the Salesforce target, specifically for the historical data load. We caught a few subtle data mapping discrepancies for older, archived quote records quite late in the UAT cycle. While we resolved them before go-live, having a more automated diffing framework from day one of the historical migration planning would have surfaced these faster and reduced some last-minute pressure on the engineering and data teams." (*Growth, Continuous Improvement*) |
| "How did you manage the dependencies between your data workstream and the core Salesforce implementation team?" | "We established daily 15-minute sync-ups between the data team leads and the Salesforce technical lead, in addition to the broader weekly Data Council. We used a shared Jira board with clearly linked dependencies for tasks like custom object deployment in Salesforce and the corresponding dbt model development. If a Salesforce schema change was planned, it was flagged to us at least one sprint in advance, allowing us to adapt our models proactively. This tight feedback loop was crucial." (*Collaboration, Planning, Communication*) |

## 4 Tell me about a time you demonstrated ownership or took initiative beyond your core responsibilities.

**Core script**

> **S (Situation):** In 2023, our data organization was rapidly expanding, nearly doubling headcount. Our previous intern onboarding process was very ad-hoc. This led to inconsistent experiences, longer ramp-up times for interns (often 2-3 weeks to their first meaningful commit), and lower-than-desired return offer acceptance rates. As someone who benefited from a strong internship experience myself, I saw a need for a more structured program.
>
> **T (Task):** Although it wasn't part of my direct responsibilities, I took the initiative to design and lead a comprehensive internship hiring and onboarding program for the data team. My goals were to create a repeatable and high-quality experience, reduce time-to-first-commit to one week, and increase our intern return-offer acceptance rate to over 80%.
>
> **A (Action):** For two consecutive years, I led this program:
> 1.  **Program Design & Recruitment:** I designed a standardized screening rubric and interview process. I personally conducted over a dozen campus interviews each cycle and worked with university relations to establish pipelines with seven key schools.
> 2.  **Onboarding & Learning:** I created a structured 6-week learning path that included hands-on dbt labs, SQL challenges, and introductions to our data stack. I organized weekly learning sessions covering topics like data modeling best practices, data quality, and effective communication.
> 3.  **Mentorship & Integration:** I matched each of the 10 interns per cohort with a senior "buddy" from the data team and helped them set clear OKRs within their first week. I also organized weekly cross-team meet-and-greets and brown-bag lunches so interns could quickly build context and relationships across the broader data organization.
> 4.  **Showcasing & Feedback:** I hosted a "Demo Day" at the end of each program where interns presented their project work to the entire data team and leadership. I also collected feedback from both interns and mentors to continuously improve the program.
>
> **R (Result):**
> *   We successfully filled all 10 intern seats each year, and the recruiting pipelines I established are now being reused by our central Talent Acquisition team.
> *   The median time for an intern to make their first production code commit dropped from over 2 weeks to just 5 days (a 65% reduction).
> *   Our intern return-offer acceptance rate increased from around 60% to 90%.
> *   The program was so successful that its structure and materials were adopted as a template for the company's 2024 new-grad onboarding program for the data analytics track.
> *   Personally, it was incredibly rewarding to see the interns grow, contribute meaningfully, and for many, to join us full-time.

| :-------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "What was the most challenging part of running the intern program?" | "The biggest challenge was ensuring a consistently high-quality project experience for each intern, given the varying workloads and priorities of different teams they might be assigned to. I addressed this by working with team leads well in advance to scope appropriate, impactful projects with clear deliverables and dedicated mentor time." (*Planning, Collaboration*) |
| "How did you secure resources or time for this initiative?"       | "Initially, I dedicated my '20% time'. As the program demonstrated clear benefits – like improved hiring outcomes and faster intern productivity – I presented a business case to my manager and HR, quantifying the ROI. This helped secure official support and budget for subsequent years." (*Influence, Strategic Thinking*) |
| "What's one thing you learned from this that you apply now?"      | "The power of structured onboarding. Creating clear expectations, providing early wins, and fostering a sense of community from day one dramatically accelerates new team members' integration and contribution. I apply these principles when onboarding any new colleague now." (*Growth, Scalable Learning*) |

## 5 Tell me about a time you contributed to the development or mentoring of others.

**Core script**

> **S (Situation):** Our team was growing, and we had a mix of new analytics engineers joining who were skilled in SQL but newer to our specific dbt production environment, coding standards, and complex domain logic. Separately, a reporting analyst on a partner team (Sales Effectiveness) was keen to develop more technical data skills.
>
> **T (Task):** I took the initiative to actively mentor these individuals to accelerate their ramp-up and empower them to contribute effectively and independently. My goal was to not just help them complete their initial tasks, but to instill best practices and a deeper understanding of our data ecosystem.
>
> **A (Action):**
> 1.  **Pair Programming & Code Reviews (New AEs):** For two new analytics engineers, Marc and Sri, I paired with them on their first production dbt models. This involved:
>     *   Walking them through our existing dbt project structure, style guides, and CI/CD processes.
>     *   Conducting thorough code reviews, focusing not just on correctness but also on performance tuning (e.g., optimizing Jinja macros, advising on incremental model strategies) and readability.
>     *   Explaining the "why" behind certain design choices, connecting the data models back to the underlying business processes and stakeholder needs (instilling domain-driven knowledge).
> 2.  **Structured Upskilling (Reporting Analyst):** For Ross, the reporting analyst, I designed a more structured upskilling plan over several months. This included:
>     *   Weekly 1:1 sessions where we'd tackle specific topics like advanced Snowflake SQL functions, dbt fundamentals (sources, models, tests), and best practices for building robust Power BI data models.
>     *   Providing him with small, manageable dbt tasks with clear guidance, gradually increasing complexity.
>     *   Helping him troubleshoot issues and encouraging him to "think like an engineer" when approaching data problems.
> 3.  **Knowledge Sharing & Documentation:** Beyond individuals, I often identify areas where our team's collective knowledge could be improved. If I solve a tricky problem or learn a new technique, I make it a point to document it briefly on our Confluence or in a team Slack channel, or even do a quick demo in our team meetings.
>
> **R (Result):**
> *   Marc and Sri became proficient in our dbt environment much faster than previous new hires. They were independently contributing complex production models within their first quarter, and their initial models had fewer bugs and better performance due to the early guidance.
> *   Ross successfully transitioned from primarily using Power BI's UI to writing his own dbt models and complex SQL queries in Snowflake. He became a key data resource for the Sales Effectiveness team, reducing their reliance on the central data team for ad-hoc requests.
> *   The practice of proactive knowledge sharing has helped reduce repetitive questions and improved the overall skill level of our team. It feels good to help others grow and see them succeed.

| "How did you adapt your mentoring style for different individuals?" | "For Marc, who had some prior Python experience, I could dive deeper into Jinja and dbt macros more quickly. For Sri, who was stronger on the SQL side but newer to git, I focused more on our branching and PR workflow initially. With Ross, I started with very foundational SQL concepts and gradually built up to dbt." (*Adaptability, Empathy*) |
| "What's the most challenging part of mentoring?"                   | "Finding the right balance between providing guidance and letting the mentee struggle a bit to learn independently. It's tempting to just give the answer, but true learning often comes from working through the problem. I try to ask guiding questions rather than providing direct solutions." (*Patience, Pedagogy*)             |
| "How do you measure the success of your mentoring efforts?"         | "Primarily by the mentee's increased independence, the quality of their work, and their confidence in tackling new challenges. Seeing them successfully deliver projects, or even start mentoring others, is the best indicator. Feedback from them and their managers is also important." (*Impact Assessment*)                             |

## 6 How have you elevated the quality, rigor, or strategic value of work in your domain? (Craft Excellence)

**Core script**

> **S (Situation):** In my roles, I've consistently looked for opportunities to move beyond just fulfilling requests to fundamentally improving our data assets and processes. Three examples come to mind: a critical business report needing a complete overhaul, a BI dashboard refresh process causing instability, and a new data ingestion pipeline that lacked a crucial strategic component.
>
> **T (Task):** My goal in each case was to not only solve the immediate problem but to elevate the quality, rigor, and long-term strategic value of the solution. This meant deeper architectural changes, robust optimizations, and thinking ahead about future analytical needs.
>
> **A (Action) & R (Result):**
>
> 1.  **Book-of-Business (BoB) Revamp:**
>     *   **A:** The existing BoB report was unreliable and lacked detail. I re-architected its data model in Snowflake and rebuilt the ETL using dbt. This involved meticulous work to ensure historical premium data was captured accurately at a granular level, which was a significant improvement in data rigor.
>     *   **R:** This unlocked trend analysis by product, region, and broker that was previously impossible, directly enabling more strategic pricing and sales targeting. It became the trusted source for this critical dataset.
>
> 2.  **Power BI → SQL Server Refresh Optimization:**
>     *   **A:** A key Power BI dashboard had a 30-minute refresh cycle that frequently failed and strained our shared SQL Server. I investigated and found inefficiencies in the incremental refresh logic. I re-configured this logic, optimized the underlying queries, and implemented CPU capping for the process.
>     *   **R:** Refresh times were halved from ~30 minutes to under 5 minutes. More importantly, refresh failures, which used to happen 2-3 times a month causing data staleness, were eliminated. This stabilized the server and ensured reliable, timely data for sales leadership.
>
> 3.  **Census Ingestion Design (Strategic Value):**
>     *   **A:** While designing a new rating ingestion pipeline, I identified a strategic gap: we weren't capturing member-level census data alongside quotes. I championed the inclusion of this, designing the schema extensions and ETL processes to integrate census data. This involved influencing engineering to expand scope by articulating the long-term analytical ROI.
>     *   **R:** This created a single source of truth connecting historical quotes to member-level details for the first time. This wasn't just a technical improvement; it unlocked entirely new strategic capabilities like cohort profitability analysis and richer renewal pricing models for our actuarial teams, significantly enhancing the value of our data.
>
> In all these instances, the focus was on building robust, efficient, and strategically valuable data solutions that stood the test of time and empowered better decision-making.

| :--------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "For the Power BI optimization, how did you identify the bottleneck?"    | "I used SQL Server Profiler to trace the queries Power BI was generating during the refresh. I noticed several inefficient joins and a table scan on a large fact table. Optimizing the DAX and the underlying SQL view, plus ensuring proper indexing, were key to the performance gains." (*Technical Depth, Analytical Skills*) |
| "What was the biggest challenge in the Book-of-Business revamp?"         | "Ensuring the accuracy of years of historical premium data, where business rules had subtly changed over time and documentation was incomplete. It required many sessions with long-tenured underwriters and finance SMEs to piece together the logic, then validate it meticulously." (*Perseverance, Attention to Detail*)     |
| "How do you balance deep-dive quality improvements with project timelines?" | "I prioritize. For critical systems like the BoB report or a failing refresh, investing in quality is non-negotiable. For less critical tasks, I might opt for a 'good enough' initial version and plan for iterative improvements. It's about risk assessment and maximizing long-term value." (*Pragmatism, Strategic Thinking*) |

## 7 Describe a time you had to influence without authority.

**Core script**

> **S (Situation):** We were in the process of designing a new ingestion pipeline for our insurance quoting system. The primary scope, as defined by product management and engineering, was focused on capturing quote header and pricing information to support sales analytics.
>
> **T (Task):** From my experience working with actuarial and underwriting teams, I knew there was a significant unmet need for member-level census data (details about the individuals covered by a group quote) to be linked directly with quote information. This data was critical for sophisticated risk modeling, cohort profitability analysis, and renewal pricing strategies, but it wasn't part of the initial MVP. My task was to advocate for and influence the engineering and product teams to expand the pipeline's scope to include census data storage and linkage.
>
> **A (Action):**
> 1.  **Built a Business Case:** I first met with key stakeholders in the actuarial and underwriting departments to understand their specific pain points and quantify the potential benefits of having linked census data. They described manual, time-consuming processes to join this data ad-hoc, often with inconsistencies.
> 2.  **Quantified ROI & Addressed Concerns:** I put together a concise proposal that highlighted the long-term analytical ROI. This included enabling more accurate risk modeling, potentially improving loss ratios, and providing data for more competitive renewal pricing. I also estimated the relatively small additional engineering effort (a few sprint points) required if we incorporated it into the initial design versus a much larger effort if it became a separate, later project.
> 3.  **Socialized & Gathered Support:** I shared this proposal with my manager and then with the lead data architect, getting their feedback and buy-in. The data architect agreed it was a strategic enhancement.
> 4.  **Presented to Engineering & Product:** Armed with actuarial sponsorship and architectural validation, I presented the case to the engineering manager and product owner for the pipeline. I focused on the strategic value and how it aligned with broader company goals of data-driven decision-making, rather than just making it a "nice-to-have" feature. I also highlighted that the data structure for census data was relatively stable and wouldn't add significant complexity if planned from the start.
>
> **R (Result):**
> *   The engineering and product teams agreed to expand the scope of the ingestion pipeline to include census data. The feature was incorporated into the design and shipped with the initial release, on schedule.
> *   The actuarial team was able to immediately leverage this integrated data, building new cohort profitability models that previously took them weeks to compile manually. This directly impacted their ability to refine pricing strategies.
> *   This success reinforced the value of cross-domain expertise and proactively advocating for data enhancements that deliver significant downstream analytical value, even if they're outside the initial project scope.

| "What if engineering had pushed back strongly on the scope increase?"  | "I would have first sought to understand their specific concerns (e.g., timeline impact, resource constraints). Then, I would have tried to negotiate a phased approach – perhaps a simpler version of census ingestion for MVP, or securing a commitment for it in the very next iteration, backed by the clear business demand." (*Negotiation, Problem Solving*) |
| "How did you get the actuarial team's sponsorship?"                    | "I scheduled a meeting specifically to discuss their analytical roadblocks. When I proposed the idea of integrating census data directly into the new pipeline, I framed it in terms of how it would solve their existing data-joining challenges and unlock new modeling capabilities they had mentioned wanting. They quickly saw the direct benefit and became strong advocates." (*Empathy, Value Proposition*) |

## 8 How do you plan to succeed at Meta?

**Core script**

> My plan has a few pillars:
> • **Learn & Contribute Quickly:** Lean into Bootcamp – Use it as user‑research: ship small diffs in 3 codebases to learn Meta infra & culture. I aim to understand the 'why' behind current systems, not just the 'how'. I'll actively seek out documentation, ask clarifying questions, and connect with teammates to accelerate my learning curve. *(Growth, Motivation, Proactive)*
> • **Drive Impact by Solving High-Leverage Problems:** I'll interview PMs, DSs, and fellow DEs across related teams to understand their biggest data pain points and identify gaps that block critical decisions or product velocity. My goal is to deliver a thin‑slice pipeline or data solution that provides tangible value within my first few cycles. This aligns with my past experience in identifying and delivering impactful solutions like the GenAI automation or the Census data ingestion. *(Proactive, Unstructured-env ownership, Motivation, Impact-Orientation)*
> • **Build a Feedback Flywheel:** I'll set clear 30/60/90‑day written goals with my manager, engage in weekly syncs, and proactively seek peer feedback using Meta's performance framework. I view constructive criticism as a gift and a catalyst for growth. *(Growth, Communication, Self-Awareness)*
> • **Foster Collaboration & Community:** I plan to contribute to data‑infra documentation if I find areas that were confusing to me as a newcomer – keeping the ladder sturdy for those who come after. I'll invest in building strong relationships with XFN partners by understanding their needs and challenges. My experience leading the Salesforce migration and the intern program showed me the power of collaborative debate to reach the best outcomes. *(Empathy, People Growth, Communication)*
> • **Embrace Challenges & Scale:** I'm excited by the scale and complexity of data at Meta. I anticipate challenges and am prepared to iterate, seek mentorship, and persistently work through blockers. I see these as opportunities to learn, innovate, and apply my skills in areas like data modeling, pipeline optimization, and ensuring data quality at scale, similar to the rigor I applied in the BoB revamp. *(Perseverance, Growth, Craft Excellence)*

| Q | A |
| --- | --- |
| "Which team or product area at Meta excites you most, and why?" | "I'm particularly excited by opportunities in [Mention a specific area, e.g., Ads Infra, Reality Labs data platform, Business Messaging data]. My experience with [mention relevant experience, e.g., building scalable data marts for Salesforce, optimizing BI systems, GenAI for workflow automation] aligns well with the challenges of [mention challenge, e.g., handling petabyte-scale event streams, building data foundations for new products, enabling real-time decisioning]. I'm keen to learn how Meta tackles X challenge at scale." |
| "What if priorities shift dramatically after you join?"         | "I'd first ensure I fully understand the new strategic direction and the 'why' behind the shift. Then, I'd conduct a quick retrospective on any ongoing work, identify reusable components or learnings, and work with my lead to re‑prioritize based on the new goals, perhaps using a framework like RICE. Clear communication with any affected stakeholders about changes and managing expectations would be key, similar to how I managed stakeholder alignment during the Salesforce migration." (*Adaptability, Communication, Proactive*) |
| "How will you handle working with entirely new technologies or systems?" | "I'm a fast learner and enjoy new challenges. I'd start by diving into documentation, seeking out internal experts or 'go-to' people for those systems, and looking for opportunities to make small, initial contributions to build hands-on experience, much like the 'ship small diffs' philosophy in Bootcamp." (*Growth, Proactive Learning*) |

## 9 How do you prioritize competing tasks?

**Core script**

> I combine a framework like RICE for roadmap items with an Eisenhower matrix for interrupts and ad-hoc requests, but critically, I ensure this is a transparent and collaborative process with my lead and stakeholders:
>
> • **RICE (Reach × Impact × Confidence ÷ Effort):** This helps objectively rank larger projects or features, typically reviewed weekly or bi-weekly with my team and lead. It facilitates data-driven discussions about what will provide the most value.
>
> • **Eisenhower Matrix (Urgent/Important):** For daily tasks and incoming requests, I quickly categorize them:
>     *   **Urgent & Important (Do):** Tackle these first.
>     *   **Important, Not Urgent (Schedule):** Block time for these.
>     *   **Urgent, Not Important (Delegate, if possible):** Can someone else handle this? Or can it be simplified?
>     *   **Not Urgent, Not Important (Delete/Defer):** Avoid or postpone.
>
> • **Transparency & Alignment:** My key principle is to make these trade‑offs visible. I communicate my proposed priorities and the reasoning behind them (e.g., in stand-ups, a shared document, or team channel). This allows stakeholders to understand the 'why', raise concerns, or provide new information that might change the prioritization, fostering buy-in.
>
> **Example** – During the Salesforce migration project, we had a critical path for delivering the interim data views to keep existing KPI dashboards live (Urgent and Important). Simultaneously, a request came from a sales strategy team for a new, complex analysis on historical quoting patterns (Important, but less Urgent than system continuity). I communicated to the strategy team that their request would be scheduled after the critical migration milestones were hit. To provide some immediate value, however, I time-boxed two hours to guide one of their analysts on how to extract a simplified subset of the data they needed from an existing, stable source, empowering them to make initial progress. This kept the main project on track while still acknowledging and partially addressing the other team's needs.

| "What if multiple tasks are Urgent and Important?" | "I'd further break them down. Which one has the highest negative impact if delayed? Which one unblocks the most other critical work? I'd consult with my lead, presenting the trade-offs and my recommended sequence. If everything is P0, then realistically, we need to de-scope or re-negotiate deadlines, communicating clearly about what *won't* get done." (*Conflict-Resolution, Communication, Strategic Thinking*) |
| "How do you handle a stakeholder who insists their 'Not Urgent' task is P0?" | "I'd first listen to understand their perspective and the underlying need fully. Then, I'd transparently share my current P0s and the reasons (e.g., critical system dependency, direct impact on a major company goal). I'd try to find a compromise: Can we break their task down? Is there an interim solution? If their need genuinely outranks existing P0s based on new information, I'd escalate to my lead to re-align priorities officially." (*Empathy, Communication, Negotiation*) |
| "What tools do you use to manage your priorities and tasks?" | "I typically use Jira or a similar ticketing system for larger project tasks and sprint planning. For personal task management and daily prioritization, a simple digital to-do list or even a physical notebook with the Eisenhower matrix works well. For team alignment, shared Confluence/Notion pages for roadmaps and decision logs are helpful." |

## 10 Tell me about a time you were wrong

**Core script**

> **S (Situation):** I was responsible for maintaining and improving our sales commission database and its associated calculation pipeline. We were undergoing a quarterly update to incorporate new sales incentives, and my task was to modify a core calculation module to reflect these new rules.
>
> **T (Task):** The primary goal was to accurately implement the new incentive logic. However, due to a misinterpretation of a nuanced business rule for a specific product category with tiered discounts, my update to the calculation process inadvertently led to an error. This resulted in incorrect commission calculations for one sales team, causing an overpayment of approximately $15,000 over a two-day period before it was detected by a Sales Ops analyst during their reconciliation.
>
> **A (Action):**
> 1.  Once the discrepancy was flagged, I immediately took ownership. My first step was to collaborate with Sales Ops to halt any further incorrect automated payouts and to precisely quantify the extent of the overpayments.
> 2.  I then conducted a thorough root cause analysis, tracing the issue to a specific conditional statement in the updated module that didn't correctly handle the tiered discount interaction for that product category. I developed and deployed a hotfix for the calculation logic within four hours, which included rerunning the affected period's calculations in a staging environment to confirm correctness before pushing to production.
> 3.  Recognizing the systemic gap, I designed and implemented several new safeguards to prevent recurrence:
>     *   I expanded our unit test suite for the calculation module, specifically adding tests that covered complex tiered scenarios and edge cases related to product-specific incentives.
>     *   I introduced automated reconciliation checks within the ETL pipeline. These checks run post-calculation and compare key aggregated commission figures against source sales data totals, flagging any variance beyond a defined threshold (e.g., 1%) before payouts are initiated.
>     *   I also proposed and helped implement a "Business Rule Sign-off" step for any changes impacting commission logic, requiring explicit confirmation from Sales Ops and Finance on the interpretation of new or ambiguous rules.
> 4.  Crucially, I proactively scheduled a post-mortem meeting with the Sales Operations Manager and the Finance lead. I presented a transparent account of the error, the immediate corrective actions, and the new preventative measures. This discussion also highlighted that our initial requirements gathering for that specific rule could have been more detailed. As a result, we collaboratively refined our requirements intake template for commission logic changes to include mandatory scenario examples for complex rules.
> 5.  Regarding the overpayment, I provided all necessary data and technical support to Sales Operations and HR, who then managed the communication and recovery process with the affected sales representatives according to company policy.
>
> **R (Result):**
> *   The corrected calculation process was immediately effective, preventing further overpayments. The new reconciliation checks and enhanced unit tests have since proactively identified two minor potential miscalculations in subsequent updates, allowing us to correct them before they impacted any payouts.
> *   The refined requirements and sign-off process with stakeholders has led to a marked decrease in ambiguity and clarification requests during development, making our update cycles more efficient. Stakeholder confidence in the commission system's accuracy was demonstrably improved.
> *   This incident was a significant learning experience. It reinforced the criticality of meticulous requirement validation with business stakeholders, especially for financial systems, and the necessity of comprehensive, scenario-based testing that covers all complex business logic. Our commission pipeline is now significantly more robust.

| "How did you technically implement the reconciliation checks in the ETL pipeline?" | "I integrated a new validation stage in our Airflow DAG. After the main commission calculation task group completed, this Python-based task would query key metrics from the source sales transaction table (e.g., total qualifying sales volume for specific incentive tiers) and compare them against the corresponding aggregated output from our commission calculation table for that period. If the variance exceeded a predefined tolerance – say, 0.5% on total payout value or 1% on qualifying transaction counts – it would raise an Airflow alert and conditionally halt the downstream payout task. This provided an automated gate before financial disbursement." (*Technical Depth, System Design, Problem Solving*) |
| "What was the most challenging aspect of addressing this error with Sales Ops and Finance?" | "The most challenging part was reassuring them about future reliability. While they understood that errors can happen and appreciated the quick fix, their primary concern was preventing recurrence in a system with direct financial implications. Simply fixing the bug wasn't enough. I had to demonstrate a clear, systemic improvement. Presenting the multi-layered approach – the enhanced unit tests, the new reconciliation checks, and the improved business rule sign-off process – was key. Walking them through how these specific safeguards would have caught this particular error, and others like it, helped rebuild their confidence that we were taking it seriously and making the system fundamentally more robust." (*Communication, Empathy, Ownership, Building Trust*) |
| "You mentioned a 'Business Rule Sign-off' step. How did you get buy-in for that, and did it slow things down?" | "Initially, there was some concern from the project manager about potential delays to our update cadence. To address this, I first piloted the sign-off on a smaller, non-critical ruleset update. I prepared a very concise summary of the proposed change and the specific business rules interpretation, along with 2-3 concrete calculation examples. This made it easy for Sales Ops and Finance to review and sign off quickly – typically within a few hours. After the pilot demonstrated minimal overhead while catching one ambiguity early, the teams were supportive of adopting it for all critical commission logic changes. The key was making the review process efficient and clearly demonstrating its value in preventing costly errors downstream." (*Influence, Collaboration, Process Improvement, Communication*) |

### Quick rehearsal tips

1. **Tailor scope to IC level** – Emphasize org‑level impact, cross‑team coordination, and proactive leadership to hit Meta's IC5/IC6 signals.
2. **Proof‑points** – Quantify results (%, $, minutes, number of teams impacted).
3. **STAR Method & Active Voice** – Use Situation, Task, Action, Result. Use "I" statements. Interviewers evaluate *clarity* as part of Communication.
4. **Signal Richness** - Aim to weave in multiple positive signals into each story naturally. The follow-ups are your chance to elaborate on signals less prominent in the main story.

Nail these, and you'll emit the right eight signals every time. Good luck—you've got this!


Behavioral & Communication:
 
 You have 5-6 STAR stories locked and loaded, covering a range of themes (leadership, conflict, big achievement, failure, teamwork, initiative, etc.). For each, you can deliver a concise narrative with a clear Result. You’ve practiced these aloud and they fit roughly into 2 minutes each.
 
 Each story in your arsenal has at least one metric or specific outcome. You won’t say generic things like “it was a success” without backing it up. You’ll say “resulted in a 15% reduction in processing time” or “the project saved $100K annually” or “the team hit the deadline 1 week early” or even qualitative outcomes like “the client signed on for an extension of the project based on our performance.” If a story currently lacks this, you’ve added something – even if approximate – because Meta interviewers love to probe for impact.
 
 You are ready for common follow-ups: “Why did you make that decision?”, “What was the hardest part?”, “What would you do differently?”, “How did you influence X?”, “How do you prioritize?” etc. You have short, honest answers to these for each story (thanks to the prep guide).
 You have practiced your tone and clarity. You will speak clearly, avoid excessive filler words, and be mindful of time. If virtual, you’ve tested your microphone and camera, and you’ll ensure not to talk over the interviewer – you’ll pause appropriately for them to jump in or ask questions.
 
 You have a strategy to handle tough or unexpected questions. If a question catches you off guard, you’ll remember to take a breath and structure a response (“Let me think – two things come to mind... first… second…”). If truly stumped, you’re prepared to ask clarifying questions or, in behavioral cases, acknowledge “I haven’t encountered exactly that, but I have a similar experience…” and then adapt.

General Mindset and Logistics:
 
 Meta Values/Mission: You’ve done a quick refresh on Meta’s mission (“Give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together”) and their values (e.g. move fast, be bold, focus on impact, etc.). You’ve subtly woven alignment to these into your answers (for example, mentioning community impact in the Carpool feature answer
GitHub
, or how you “focused on impact” in a project). This isn’t mandatory, but if the opportunity arises (like “Why Meta?”), you can genuinely speak to how you connect with their mission or products.

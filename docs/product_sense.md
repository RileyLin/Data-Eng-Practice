# Product Sense Questions

This document contains product sense questions from the study guide, organized by scenario.

## Scenario 1: Ride Sharing (Uber/Lyft) - Carpooling Feature

### Question 1.1.1: Value Proposition & Mission Alignment

**Description:**  
Why would a large tech company invest in a carpooling feature for its ride-sharing service? How does it align with the company's mission (e.g., connecting people, building community)?

**Key Discussion Points:**
- Value proposition for riders (lower price point)
- Value proposition for drivers (potentially more earnings per trip)
- Value proposition for the platform (increased overall ride volume, improved fleet efficiency)
- Value proposition for community/city (reduced traffic congestion, reduced emissions)
- Mission alignment (connecting people, fostering efficient communities)

### Question 1.1.2: Tracking Performance

**Description:**  
Imagine you launched the Carpool feature. How would you track its performance? What are the key metrics, and how would you slice the data?

**Key Metrics to Consider:**
- Adoption: Carpool Ride Penetration, Request Success Rate, Active Users Utilizing Carpool
- Efficiency & Economics: Average Fill Rate, Average Detour Time/Distance, Driver Earnings, Revenue per Mile
- User Experience: Rider CSAT/NPS, Driver CSAT/NPS, Cancellation Rate

**Slicing Dimensions:**
- Time: Hour of day, day of week, weekday vs. weekend
- Geography: City, specific zones/neighborhoods, route corridors
- User Segment: New vs. existing users, demographics, price sensitivity
- Driver Segment: Tenure, vehicle type, rating
- Ride Characteristics: Trip distance, time of day, number of matched passengers

## Scenario 2: Short Video (TikTok/Reels) - Sharing Focus

### Question 2.1.1: Measuring Success

**Description:**  
You are launching Reels/Shorts. What are the key metrics for platform health and user engagement?

### Question 2.1.2: User Location Changes

**Description:**  
How would you track if a user significantly changes their 'regular' location (e.g., moves cities) based on their activity?

### Question 2.1.3: Engagement Comparison

**Description:**  
How would you compare the engagement (e.g., likes) of original content versus content that is shared (i.e., a re-share of an original post)? What insights would this provide?

### Question 2.1.4: Dashboard Visualization

**Description:**  
How would you design a dashboard visualization to show how the launch of Reels is affecting engagement with other platform features (e.g., standard posts, image uploads, long-form videos)?

## Scenario 3: Streaming Platform (Netflix/Hulu)

### Question 3.1.1: User Engagement Tracking

**Description:**  
For a video streaming platform, what are the different types of user engagement you could track? Define key metrics at the Platform, User, and Video levels.

## Scenario 4: Cloud File Storage (Dropbox/Google Drive)

### Question 4.1.1: Feature Impact Analysis

**Description:**  
You're considering adding a new "Quick Access" feature that uses ML to predict which files a user might need next. How would you measure the success of this feature? What metrics would you track?

## Scenario 5: DAU/MAU Analysis

### Question 5.1.1: Stickiness Metrics

**Description:**  
Besides the DAU/MAU ratio, what other metrics would you use to measure user stickiness and engagement for a social media platform?

## Scenario 6: News Feed

### Question 6.1.1: Feed Optimization

**Description:**  
If you were to optimize the News Feed algorithm, what metrics would you track to ensure a good user experience? How would you balance content diversity with engagement?

## Scenario 7: Photo Upload (Instagram-like)

### Question 7.1.1: Upload Experience

**Description:**  
How would you measure the quality of the photo upload experience for users? What metrics would help identify friction points in the process?

## Scenario 8: FB Messenger

### Question 8.1.1: Engagement Patterns

**Description:**  
What metrics would you use to analyze messaging patterns and identify highly engaged users versus users at risk of churning?

## Scenario 9: Food Delivery (DoorDash) - Order Batching

### Question 9.1.1: Batch Order Optimization

**Description:**  
How would you measure the success of a new order batching algorithm? What metrics would you track from the customer, driver, and platform perspectives?

# Python Interview Question Solutions

This directory contains solutions to the Python interview questions from the main repository.

## Solutions Created

1. **q001_ride_overlapping.py** - Solution to check if a user's ride requests overlap
2. **q002_carpool_capacity.py** - Solution to check if a vehicle can complete rides without exceeding capacity
3. **q003_session_engagement.py** - Solution to process engagement events with session buffering
4. **q004_fixed_buffer_stream.py** - Solution for fixed-size buffer for processing event streams
5. **q005_average_rating_category.py** - Solution to calculate average ratings per movie category
6. **q006_top_n_movies.py** - Solution to find top N movies by rating for each category

## Running Solutions

Each solution file can be executed directly to run its tests:

```bash
python q001_ride_overlapping.py
```

## Comparison with Original Questions

These solutions correct bugs and implement missing functionality from the original questions in `src/python/`. All solutions have been tested and pass their respective test cases.

## Additional Solutions to Add

The following solutions still need to be implemented:

- q007_average_movie_ratings.py
- q008_newsfeed_view_validation.py
- q009_photo_upload.py
- q010_sql_generation.py
- q011_order_batching.py

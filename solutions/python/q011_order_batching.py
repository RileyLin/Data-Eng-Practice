Scenario 9: Food Delivery (DoorDash) - Order Batching
Question 9.4.1: Order Batching Feasibility

Description:
Determine if a new order can feasibly be added to a Dasher's current batch.
Implement a conceptual Python function `can_add_to_batch(current_batch_details, new_order_details, dasher_current_location, current_time)`
that considers factors like deadlines, travel times, and the impact on existing orders.

This function is conceptual, meaning it should outline the logic and considerations rather than
implementing complex geospatial calculations or real-time traffic APIs.

Key Considerations:
- `current_batch_details`: List of orders already in the batch. Each order could have:
    - `order_id`
    - `pickup_location` (e.g., (lat, lon) or address string)
    - `dropoff_location`
    - `pickup_deadline` (timestamp)
    - `dropoff_deadline` (timestamp)
    - `estimated_pickup_time` (if already routed)
    - `estimated_dropoff_time` (if already routed)
    - `order_items_volume` (e.g., small, medium, large - for Dasher capacity)

- `new_order_details`: Details of the new order to consider adding. Similar structure to batch orders.
    - `order_id`
    - `pickup_location`
    - `dropoff_location`
    - `pickup_deadline`
    - `dropoff_deadline`
    - `order_items_volume`

- `dasher_current_location`: Current location of the Dasher.
- `current_time`: Current timestamp.

- `dasher_capacity`: Maximum volume/number of orders a Dasher can handle (e.g., a fixed constant or Dasher profile attribute).

Conceptual Logic Points:
1.  **Capacity Check**: Can the Dasher carry the items from the new order plus existing orders?
2.  **Route Recalculation (Conceptual)**: Imagine a new route is formed including the new order's pickup and dropoff.
    - This would involve finding an optimal insertion point for the new pickup and dropoff into the existing sequence.
3.  **Deadline Adherence**: 
    - Would picking up and dropping off the new order cause any *existing* orders in the batch to miss their pickup or dropoff deadlines?
    - Can the new order itself be picked up and dropped off by its deadlines given the recalculated route?
4.  **Travel Time Estimation (Conceptual)**: A helper function `estimate_travel_time(loc_A, loc_B, mode_of_transport)` would be needed.
    For this problem, we can use a placeholder or simplified logic (e.g., Manhattan distance if locations are grid points, or just symbolic time additions).
5.  **Detour Impact**: How much does adding the new order increase the total travel time or delay existing orders? Is there a maximum acceptable detour/delay?

Function Signature:
`can_add_to_batch(current_batch_details: list[dict], new_order_details: dict, dasher_current_location, current_time: int, dasher_capacity: dict) -> bool`

Return `True` if the new order can be added feasibly, `False` otherwise.

    # 2. Route Recalculation and Deadline Adherence (Conceptual)
    # This is the most complex part. We need to simulate adding the new order
    # and check if all deadlines can still be met.

    # For simplicity, let's assume orders are processed sequentially based on a combined list.
    # A real system would try optimal insertion points for the new order's pickup and dropoff.

    # Create a list of all stops: (type='pickup'/'dropoff', order_id, location, deadline, original_order_ref)
    # For existing orders, we might have estimated completion times. For new ones, we calculate.

    # Let's simplify: Assume a greedy approach. Try to fit the new order. 
    # We need to evaluate if *any* valid sequence exists. A full algorithm is complex.
    # This conceptual function will focus on the checks rather than the full routing permutation.

    # Simplified check: can the new order be picked up and delivered by its own deadlines,
    # and does adding it not violate existing *committed* deadlines by too much?
    # This is hard to do without a full route simulation. 

    # Let's make a high-level conceptual check based on direct travel from current location:
    time_to_new_pickup = estimate_travel_time(dasher_current_location, new_order_details['pickup_location'])
    estimated_pickup_time_new = current_time + time_to_new_pickup

    if estimated_pickup_time_new > new_order_details['pickup_deadline']:
        print(f"Failed: New order pickup deadline ({new_order_details['pickup_deadline']}) missed. ETA: {estimated_pickup_time_new}")
        return False
    
    # Assume pickup happens at estimated_pickup_time_new or deadline, whichever is later (if Dasher waits)
    actual_pickup_time_new = max(estimated_pickup_time_new, current_time) # Dasher can't go back in time
    # Or, more realistically, Dasher aims for estimated_pickup_time_new

    time_from_new_pickup_to_new_dropoff = estimate_travel_time(new_order_details['pickup_location'], new_order_details['dropoff_location'])
    estimated_dropoff_time_new = actual_pickup_time_new + time_from_new_pickup_to_new_dropoff

    if estimated_dropoff_time_new > new_order_details['dropoff_deadline']:
        print(f"Failed: New order dropoff deadline ({new_order_details['dropoff_deadline']}) missed. ETA: {estimated_dropoff_time_new}")
        return False

    # Now, consider impact on existing orders. This is the trickiest part conceptually without full routing.
    # A simple proxy: Does the detour for the new order add excessive time?
    # Total time for new order if done in isolation after current tasks: 
    # (current_loc -> new_pickup -> new_dropoff)
    # This doesn't account for interleaving. 

    # For a conceptual check, let's assume that if the new order itself is feasible in isolation 
    # (as checked above), and capacity is fine, we might allow it. 
    # A more robust check would simulate the new route and verify all deadlines.
    
    # For example, one could check if the *latest* existing dropoff_deadline is pushed too far.
    # This requires knowing the current route and its timings for existing orders.
    # If `current_batch_details` included `estimated_dropoff_time` for each order based on the *current* route:
    if current_batch_details:
        latest_existing_dropoff_deadline = max(o['dropoff_deadline'] for o in current_batch_details)
        # This is a very coarse check. Adding a new order could affect earlier orders more.
        # A true check would re-route and verify *all* existing order deadlines.
        # Let's assume for this conceptual problem, if the new order itself fits its deadlines, 
        # and capacity is okay, we are optimistic unless we have specific constraints on existing orders.
        
        # A placeholder for impact analysis: if adding the new order (pickup + delivery time) extends the
        # day beyond a certain threshold for the Dasher, or makes an existing order very late.
        max_allowable_delay_for_existing_orders = 30 # minutes (conceptual)

        # To do this properly, one would simulate inserting the new order's pickup & dropoff
        # into the existing route and re-calculate all ETAs for existing orders.
        # Then check if new_ETA <= original_deadline for all existing orders.
        # And new_ETA <= original_ETA + max_allowable_delay_for_existing_orders.

        # As this is conceptual, we'll skip the complex re-routing simulation here.
        # The problem asks for *considerations*. The above deadline checks for the new order are key.
        # The capacity check is also key.
        # A full solution would involve a route optimization step.
        pass # Placeholder for more sophisticated existing order impact analysis.

Question 12: Restaurant Delivery Time Calculation - SOLUTION

This problem requires tracking driver movements and calculating total delivery time
for each order from pickup to dropoff, including all intermediate travel time.

Key insights:
1. Track each order's pickup and dropoff times
2. Calculate travel time between consecutive locations for each driver
3. For orders being carried, accumulate all travel time until dropoff
4. Handle multiple drivers independently
5. Sort output by order number

Time Complexity: O(n + m log m) where n is actions, m is unique orders
Space Complexity: O(m + d) where m is orders, d is drivers

DATA STRUCTURE EXAMPLES:

Input: actions (List[Dict])
- Structure: [{'location': str, 'order_no': str (optional), 'action_type': str, 'driver': str}, ...]
- action_type values: 'pick_up', 'travel', 'drop_off'
- order_no: only present for 'pick_up' and 'drop_off' actions

Example action dictionaries:
- Pickup action: {'location': 'A', 'order_no': 'order_1', 'action_type': 'pick_up', 'driver': 'driver_1'}
- Travel action: {'location': 'B', 'action_type': 'travel', 'driver': 'driver_1'}  # No order_no
- Dropoff action: {'location': 'C', 'order_no': 'order_1', 'action_type': 'drop_off', 'driver': 'driver_1'}

Input: travel_matrix (List[List[int]])
- Structure: 2D matrix where travel_matrix[i][j] = travel time from location i to location j
- Indices correspond to location_mapping values
- Diagonal elements are 0 (no travel time to same location)

Example travel_matrix:
travel_matrix = [
    [0, 5, 10, 15],  # From A (index 0) to [A, B, C, D]
    [5, 0, 8, 12],   # From B (index 1) to [A, B, C, D]
    [10, 8, 0, 6],   # From C (index 2) to [A, B, C, D]
    [15, 12, 6, 0]   # From D (index 3) to [A, B, C, D]
]

Input: location_mapping (Dict[str, int])
- Structure: {location_name: matrix_index}
- Maps location strings to travel_matrix indices

Example location_mapping:
location_mapping = {'A': 0, 'B': 1, 'C': 2, 'D': 3}

DETAILED SCENARIO WALKTHROUGH:

Scenario: Single driver picks up two orders and delivers them

Actions sequence:
1. {'location': 'A', 'order_no': 'order_1', 'action_type': 'pick_up', 'driver': 'driver_1'}
2. {'location': 'A', 'action_type': 'travel', 'driver': 'driver_1'}
3. {'location': 'B', 'order_no': 'order_2', 'action_type': 'pick_up', 'driver': 'driver_1'}
4. {'location': 'B', 'action_type': 'travel', 'driver': 'driver_1'}
5. {'location': 'C', 'order_no': 'order_1', 'action_type': 'drop_off', 'driver': 'driver_1'}
6. {'location': 'C', 'action_type': 'travel', 'driver': 'driver_1'}
7. {'location': 'D', 'order_no': 'order_2', 'action_type': 'drop_off', 'driver': 'driver_1'}

Timeline Processing:
Time 0: Pick up order_1 at A
Time 0‚Üí5: Travel A to B (5 mins)
Time 5: Pick up order_2 at B
Time 5‚Üí13: Travel B to C (8 mins)
Time 13: Drop off order_1 at C (total time for order_1: 13 mins)
Time 13‚Üí19: Travel C to D (6 mins)
Time 19: Drop off order_2 at D (total time for order_2: 19 - 5 = 14 mins)

MULTIPLE DRIVERS SCENARIO:

Actions for multiple drivers:
[
    {'location': 'A', 'order_no': 'order_3', 'action_type': 'pick_up', 'driver': 'driver_1'},
    {'location': 'B', 'order_no': 'order_4', 'action_type': 'pick_up', 'driver': 'driver_2'},
    {'location': 'A', 'action_type': 'travel', 'driver': 'driver_1'},
    {'location': 'B', 'action_type': 'travel', 'driver': 'driver_2'},
    {'location': 'C', 'order_no': 'order_3', 'action_type': 'drop_off', 'driver': 'driver_1'},
    {'location': 'A', 'order_no': 'order_4', 'action_type': 'drop_off', 'driver': 'driver_2'}
]

Processing:
- driver_1: picks up order_3 at A, travels to C, drops off order_3
- driver_2: picks up order_4 at B, travels to A, drops off order_4

EDGE CASES TO CONSIDER:

1. Driver stays at same location (no travel time added)
2. Multiple orders carried simultaneously
3. Orders dropped off in different sequence than picked up
4. Multiple drivers working independently
5. Travel actions without corresponding location changes
6. Missing pickup or dropoff actions

OUTPUT FORMAT:
The function should print results in order number sequence:
"order_1 is delivered within 15 mins"
"order_2 is delivered within 20 mins"

ALGORITHM APPROACH:
1. Group actions by driver to create individual timelines
2. For each driver, process actions sequentially:
   - Track current location and time
   - Calculate travel time when location changes
   - Record pickup times for orders
   - Calculate delivery time when orders are dropped off
3. Sort results by order number and print

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- The timeline approach is more robust than trying to process all actions globally
- Each driver operates independently with their own timeline
- Travel time is only added when location actually changes
- Orders can be carried simultaneously and dropped off in any order

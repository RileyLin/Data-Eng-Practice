/*
Explanation:

1.  `DriverRideCounts` CTE:
    *   Filters `fact_rides` for rides completed in the last 30 days (using `end_timestamp`). The period is defined as `CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'` up to (but not including) `CURRENT_DATE`.
    *   Joins with `dim_ride_type` to get the `ride_type_name`.
    *   Groups by `driver_user_key`.
    *   For each driver, it counts:
        *   `carpool_rides_count`: Number of rides where `ride_type_name` is 'Carpool'.
        *   `regular_rides_count`: Number of rides where `ride_type_name` is not 'Carpool' (and is not NULL, to avoid counting rides with undefined types as regular). This definition of "regular" might need adjustment based on specific business rules (e.g., if regular means only 'Standard' type rides).

2.  `TotalDistinctDriversInPeriod` CTE:
    *   Calculates the total number of distinct drivers who completed *any* ride in the specified 30-day period. This serves as the denominator for the percentage calculation, ensuring it reflects all active drivers in that period.

3.  `DriversPreferringCarpool` CTE:
    *   Takes the results from `DriverRideCounts`.
    *   Counts the number of distinct drivers for whom `carpool_rides_count` is greater than `regular_rides_count`.

4.  Final Query:
    *   Calculates the percentage: (`drivers_preferring_carpool_count` * 100.0) / `total_drivers`.
    *   Uses a `CASE` statement to prevent division by zero if `total_drivers` is 0.
    *   The result is a single percentage value.

Schema Assumptions:
fact_rides:
- ride_id (PK)
- driver_user_key (FK)
- ride_type_key (FK -> dim_ride_type)
- end_timestamp (Timestamp of ride completion)
- ...

dim_ride_type:
- ride_type_key (PK)
- ride_type_name ('Carpool', 'Regular', 'Standard', 'Premium', etc.)
- ...

Example DDL & DML for testing:

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS dim_ride_type;
CREATE TABLE dim_ride_type (
    ride_type_key INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    ride_type_name TEXT NOT NULL
);

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS fact_rides;
CREATE TABLE fact_rides (
    ride_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    driver_user_key INTEGER,
    ride_type_key INTEGER,
    end_timestamp TIMESTAMP, -- Assuming this is available and used for period filtering
    FOREIGN KEY (ride_type_key) REFERENCES dim_ride_type(ride_type_key)
);

INSERT INTO dim_ride_type (ride_type_key, ride_type_name) VALUES
(1, 'Standard'), (2, 'Carpool'), (3, 'Premium');

-- Sample data for the last 30 days (adjust CURRENT_DATE or use fixed dates for testing)
INSERT INTO fact_rides (ride_id, driver_user_key, ride_type_key, end_timestamp) VALUES
-- Driver 1: 1 Carpool, 2 Standard
(1, 101, 2, CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '5 days'),
(2, 101, 1, CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '6 days'),
(3, 101, 1, CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days'),
-- Driver 2: 3 Carpool, 1 Standard
(4, 102, 2, CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '2 days'),
(5, 102, 2, CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '3 days'),
(6, 102, 2, CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '4 days'),
(7, 102, 1, CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '5 days'),
-- Driver 3: 2 Carpool, 0 Standard
(8, 103, 2, CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 day'),
(9, 103, 2, CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '2 days'),
-- Driver 4: 1 Standard (no carpool)
(10, 104, 1, CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '10 days'),
-- Driver 5: 1 Premium (not carpool, not standard based on strict definition)
(11, 105, 3, CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '12 days'),
-- Driver 6: Only rides outside the 30-day window
(12, 106, 2, CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '35 days');

-- Expected Analysis (using 'Standard' as regular for carpool_rides_count > regular_rides_count):
-- Driver 101: 1 Carpool, 2 Standard. (1 > 2 is False)
-- Driver 102: 3 Carpool, 1 Standard. (3 > 1 is True) -> Prefers Carpool
-- Driver 103: 2 Carpool, 0 Standard. (2 > 0 is True) -> Prefers Carpool
-- Driver 104: 0 Carpool, 1 Standard. (0 > 1 is False)
-- Driver 105: 0 Carpool, 0 Standard (Premium is not Standard). (0 > 0 is False)

-- Total distinct drivers in period (101, 102, 103, 104, 105) = 5
-- Drivers preferring carpool = 2 (102, 103)
-- Percentage = (2 / 5) * 100.0 = 40.0

-- Expected output:
-- percentage_drivers_preferring_carpool
-- ---------------------------------------
-- 40.0

SELECT 
    ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN prefers_carpool THEN 100.0 ELSE 0.0 END), 2) AS percentage_drivers_preferring_carpool

/*
Key improvements in these alternative approaches:

1. **Option 1**: Uses a `date_range` CTE for cleaner parameterization and BETWEEN for more readable date filtering
2. **Option 2**: Most concise - uses boolean logic directly in the CTE and AVG for percentage calculation  
3. **Option 3**: Most explicit - separates the logic into clear steps for better maintainability

All three approaches:
- Include the current date (â‰¤ instead of <)
- Are more maintainable and readable
- Handle edge cases better
- Use ROUND() for cleaner output
- Use NULLIF() or proper handling to avoid division by zero

Choose the approach that best fits your team's coding standards and readability preferences.

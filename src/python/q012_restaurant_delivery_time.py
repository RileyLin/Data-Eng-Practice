Question 12: DoorDash Food Delivery Time Calculation

You are given two inputs to calculate the delivery time for each order:

1. A list of dictionaries representing driver actions, where each dict contains:
   - location: string (location identifier)
   - order_no: string (order number, only present for 'pick_up' and 'drop_off' actions)
   - action_type: string ('pick_up', 'travel', 'drop_off')
   - driver: string (driver identifier)

2. A 2D matrix representing travel times between locations

Key Points:
- When action_type is 'travel', there is NO order_no in the record
- A driver can pick up multiple orders before dropping them off
- ALL time between picking up an order and dropping it off counts toward that order's delivery time
- Print results as: "order xx is delivered within xxx mins"
- Print in order number sequence

Example:
Driver picks up order_1 at location A, travels to B to pick up order_2, 
then travels to C to drop off order_1. The travel time from Aâ†’B also counts 
toward order_1's delivery time since the driver was carrying it.

    # Algorithm:
    # 1. Group actions by driver to process each driver's timeline separately
    # 2. For each driver, track:
    #    - Current location and time
    #    - Orders currently being carried
    #    - Pickup time for each order
    # 3. Process actions sequentially:
    #    - For 'travel': calculate travel time and update all carried orders
    #    - For 'pick_up': record order pickup time and add to carried orders
    #    - For 'drop_off': calculate total delivery time and remove from carried orders
    # 4. Sort results by order number and print

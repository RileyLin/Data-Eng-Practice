Question: Feasibility of Adding Order to Batch - Conceptual

Imagine a Dasher (food delivery driver) is currently handling a batch of one or more orders, each
with specific pickup restaurant locations and customer delivery locations/time windows. A new order
request comes in.

You need to implement a conceptual function:
`can_add_to_batch(current_batch_details, new_order_details, dasher_current_location, current_time)`

The function should determine if the new order can be feasibly added to the current batch without
causing existing orders to be excessively late.

Key considerations:
- All orders have a promised delivery deadline
- Orders must be picked up from restaurants first
- Restaurant preparation time for the new order
- Travel times between locations
- Impact of the added order on the existing delivery route/timeline
- Maximum allowable delay for existing orders

Example Input (Conceptual):
current_batch_details = [
    {
        'order_id': 'A1', 
        'restaurant_loc': (37.7749, -122.4194),  # San Francisco
        'customer_loc': (37.7858, -122.4064),    # Near Chinatown
        'promised_delivery_deadline': 1617304800, # Unix timestamp
        'est_pickup_time': 1617303900            # 15 min before deadline
    },
    {
        'order_id': 'A2', 
        'restaurant_loc': (37.7749, -122.4244),  # Slight variation
        'customer_loc': (37.7958, -122.4864),    # Further away
        'promised_delivery_deadline': 1617305100, # 5 min after A1
        'est_pickup_time': 1617304200            # 15 min before deadline
    }
]

new_order_details = {
    'order_id': 'B1',
    'restaurant_loc': (37.7649, -122.4194), 
    'customer_loc': (37.7948, -122.4864),
    'promised_delivery_deadline': 1617305400,
    'est_pickup_time': 1617304500,
    'est_prep_time_remaining': 10 * 60  # 10 minutes in seconds
}

dasher_current_location = (37.7759, -122.4104)  # Current driver location
current_time = 1617303600  # Unix timestamp

Your task is to outline a conceptual approach for determining whether the new order can reasonably be added to the batch. Focus on the key factors to consider rather than implementing a complete routing algorithm.

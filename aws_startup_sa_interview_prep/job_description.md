# AWS Solution Architect - Startups

Trusted by more startups around the world, AWS makes the power of cloud computing accessible for all by giving founders everywhere access to the same technology that powers the world’s largest companies. With experience gained from supporting hundreds of thousands of startups that have come before, we help founders prove that their world-changing ideas are possible, at any stage of growth or level of funding. This is why more startups, and over 80% of unicorns, build on AWS.

We are looking for technical builders who love the idea of working with early stage startups to help them as they grow. In this role, you’ll work directly with a variety of interesting customers and help them make the best (and sometimes the most pragmatic) technical decisions along the way. You’ll have a chance to build enduring relationships with these companies and establish yourself as a trusted advisor.

As a member of the AWS Startups team, you will work directly with customers to help them successfully leverage AWS technology at scale.

As well as spending time working directly with customers, you’ll also get plenty of time to learn new technologies and keep your skills fresh. We have 200+ services across a range of different categories and it’s important that we can help startups take advantages of the right ones. You’ll also play an important role as an advocate with our product teams to make sure we are building the right products and features for the startups you work with. And for the customers you don’t get to work with on a 1:1 basis you’ll share knowledge more broadly by working on technical content and presenting at events.

## A day in the life

Startups are the large enterprises of the future. These young companies are founded by ambitious people who have a desire to build something meaningful and to challenge the status quo. To address underserved customers or to challenge incumbents. They usually operate in an environment of scarcity: whether that's capital, engineering resource, or experience.

The AWS Startup Solutions Architecture team is dedicated to working with startup companies as they build their businesses. We're here to help them deploy the best, most scalable, most secure, cost effective and easy to operate architectures.

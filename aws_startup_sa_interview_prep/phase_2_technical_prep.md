# Phase 2: Technical Preparation

This document is for tracking your preparation for the two technical interview sessions. The focus is on demonstrating your architectural thought process, not just recalling facts.

## 1. The "Discovery-First" Approach

**Instructions:** Before designing a solution for the scenarios below, write down at least 5-10 clarifying questions you would ask the customer. This trains the "mandatory" discovery-first muscle.

## 2. "Justification Library"

**Instructions:** For each common technology or architectural choice, write a concise, one-sentence justification. This will prepare you to explain your decisions clearly and quickly.

### Your SalesMart Dashboard Project

*   **Managed Data Warehouse (e.g., Amazon Redshift):**
    *   *Justification:* "I chose a managed data warehouse to reduce operational overhead, which is critical for a small team, allowing us to focus on business logic, not patching servers."
*   **Data Transformation Tool (e.g., dbt):**
    *   *Justification:* "I used a tool like dbt because it enables operational excellence by treating our SQL as version-controlled, tested code, which is more reliable and maintainable."
*   **BI Tool (e.g., Amazon QuickSight):**
    *   *Justification:* 
*   **Data Quality Framework (e.g., Great Expectations):**
    *   *Justification:* 
*   **Cloud Storage (e.g., Amazon S3):**
    *   *Justification:* 

### General Architectural Patterns

*   **Serverless Compute (e.g., AWS Lambda):**
    *   *Justification:* 
*   **Containers (e.g., Amazon ECS/EKS):**
    *   *Justification:* 
*   **Managed Database (e.g., Amazon RDS):**
    *   *Justification:* 
*   **NoSQL Database (e.g., Amazon DynamoDB):**
    *   *Justification:* 
*   **API Gateway:**
    *   *Justification:* 
*   **Load Balancer:**
    *   *Justification:*

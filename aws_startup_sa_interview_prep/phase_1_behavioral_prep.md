# Phase 1: Behavioral Preparation

This document is for tracking your preparation for the behavioral questions in the AWS onsite interview. The primary goal is to map your existing stories to the 16 Amazon Leadership Principles (LPs) and refine your delivery.

## 1. Leadership Principle (LP) to Story Matrix

**Instructions:** Use this matrix to ensure you have a unique, strong story for each LP. Aim to have a primary and a backup story for as many as possible. Fill in the "Justification & Key Talking Points" to crystallize why each story fits the LP.

| Leadership Principle | Primary Story | Backup Story | Justification & Key Talking Points |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Customer Obsession** | Claims Gen-AI Solution | SalesMart Dashboard | Started with the Claims team's (customer) pain. Went above and beyond to solve it. |
| **Ownership** | Census Pipeline | Commission RCA | You saw a critical gap no one owned and solved it yourself without authority. |
| **Invent and Simplify** | Claims Gen-AI Solution | Power BI Latency Fix | Took a complex, manual process (PDF reading) and created a simple, novel solution. |
| **Are Right, A Lot** | SalesMart Dashboard | Census Pipeline | Your judgment to hold metric-workshops prevented rework. Your intuition on census data proved correct. |
| **Learn and Be Curious** | Claims Gen-AI Solution | | You taught yourself a new technology (LLMs) in your evenings to solve a business problem. |
| **Hire and Develop the Best** | *Mentoring Story* | | *Focus on mentoring Ross, the reporting analyst, or the junior engineers from the SFDC migration.* |
| **Insist on the Highest Standards**| Book-of-Business Revamp| SalesMart Dashboard | Used Great Expectations (GE) tests and rigorous data validation to ensure zero quality incidents. |
| **Think Big** | Claims Gen-AI Solution | Census Pipeline | You framed the Gen-AI POC not as a one-off tool but as a scalable pattern for the entire company. |
| **Bias for Action** | Census Pipeline | Claims Gen-AI Solution | Built a POC in your own time to break a deadlock instead of waiting. Speed and action led to results. |
| **Frugality** | Power BI Latency Fix | | Solved a major performance issue with no extra hardware, achieving more with existing resources. |
| **Earn Trust** | Commission RCA | Salesforce Migration | You owned a mistake transparently, communicated clearly, and implemented systems to prevent repeats. |
| **Dive Deep** | Commission RCA | Power BI Latency Fix | You performed a deep root cause analysis (RCA) to find the specific logic bug under pressure. |
| **Have Backbone; Disagree & Commit**| Census Pipeline | | You had a professional disagreement with Engineering on priorities and used data (ROI deck) to convince them. |
| **Deliver Results** | SalesMart Dashboard | Book-of-Business Revamp | The result was clear, quantifiable, and massive: $1.5M premium lift, top-3 dashboard. |
| **Strive to be Earth's Best Employer**| *Mentoring Story* | | *Focus on teamwork and how you've helped create a positive work environment.* |
| **Success and Scale Bring Broad Responsibility**| *Security/Compliance Story*| | *Focus on the security/broader implications of your designs, like role-based access in Snowflake.* |

## 2. "Negative Style" Question Preparation

**Primary Story:** `Commission RCA (Failure â†’ Learning)`

**Instructions:** Practice delivering this story using the specific three-part framework requested in the prep call. Write out your talking points for each section.

*   **Humility (Own the mistake):**
    *   *Your Talking Points:* "I made a mistake in the logic that caused a $15k overpayment..."

*   **Vocal Self-Criticism (Analyze what went wrong):**
    *   *Your Talking Points:* "The root cause was my misinterpretation of a nuanced rule and an inadequate test case for that specific scenario..."

*   **Course Correction (Prevent repeat mistakes):**
    *   *Your Talking Points:* "To prevent it from ever happening again, I implemented three new safeguards: expanded unit tests, automated reconciliation checks, and a new business sign-off process..."

## 3. Quantify All Results (Checklist)

For every story you tell, ensure you include at least one of the three result angles.

*   [ ] **Customer Impact (Strongest):** Does my story include a clear, quantitative metric showing how it helped the customer? (e.g., time savings, revenue increase).
*   [ ] **Business Impact:** Does my story show how it benefited the company beyond the immediate customer? (e.g., new process adopted, influenced product teams).
*   [ ] **Lessons Learned (Required for failure stories):** Does my story clearly articulate what I learned and how I applied it?

# Amazon Web Services startup solutions architect interview prep call

Wed, 24 Sept 25

### Interview Structure & Logistics

- 5 one-hour sessions with max 2 people each (likely 5-8 total interviewers)
- Sessions include individual interviewers plus “shadows” (learning observers)
  - Shadows observe to calibrate hiring bar (required 10+ shadowed interviews)
  - Shadows stay off camera, introduce themselves, available for Q&A
- Amazon Chime platform (same as this prep call)
  - Arrive 1-2 minutes early for technical grace period
  - Test WiFi and video connectivity beforehand
  - Download Chime mobile app as backup
- Timing windows: first interview 11am Eastern, last ends 5pm Eastern
- Built-in breaks between sessions (ask for bathroom/water breaks if needed)
- Very casual dress code: jeans + button up acceptable, no suit required
- Interviewers will type responses to capture stories accurately
- Notes allowed: use paper/printout vs computer (avoids LLM appearance concern)
- Final schedule sent 2-3 business days before October 1st interview

### Behavioral Questions Strategy

- Every interviewer asks behavioral questions regardless of role
- Each interviewer assigned 2-3 specific leadership principles to evaluate
- Strategy: answer the question asked, don’t guess the leadership principle
  - Example: “Tell me about obstacle in delivery” vs “Tell me about delivering results”
- Use STAR technique for all behavioral responses
  - Situation/Task: provide context and foundation
  - Action/Result: primary focus areas
  - Write notes in STAR format if using reference materials
- Prepare unique story for each of 16 leadership principles beforehand
- Use different examples with each interviewer when possible
  - Maximum 2 interviewers can hear same story
  - Keep all details identical if repeating stories
- Watch “I” vs “we” language - emphasize specific personal contributions
- Ask clarifying questions if uncertain about what’s being asked

### Negative Style Questions

- Expect questions about failures/mistakes across multiple principles
  - “Time you took risk that didn’t work out” (Bias for Action)
  - “Judgment call that was wrong” (Are Right A Lot)
  - “Time you received critical feedback” (Earn Trust)
- Amazon seeks three qualities in failure responses:
  - Humility: can you own the mistake?
  - Vocal self-criticism: can you analyze what went wrong?
  - Course correction: what actions prevent repeat mistakes?
- Never answer “I’ve never received critical feedback” - worst possible response
- Feedback culture at Amazon: expect input from managers, teammates, cross-functional peers, customers

### Results Framework

- Include at least one of three result angles in every behavioral answer:
- Customer impact (strongest option)
  - Quantitative data preferred over qualitative (measurable/scalable/replicable)
  - Examples: revenue increases, time savings, improved cycle times
  - Customer-facing role requires demonstrating customer influence
- Business impact for your company
  - Shows larger scope beyond immediate customer
  - Examples: new processes adopted company-wide, influencing product teams
  - Relevant to SA role: bringing AWS revenue, customer feedback to product teams
- Lessons learned
  - Acceptable for negative/failure questions
  - Apply learnings to future engagements
  - Not sufficient alone for presentation (needs customer or business impact)

### Technical Sessions

- 2 sessions with Solutions Architects include technical questions
- Topics: system architecture, scenario design, domain depth
- Discovery-first approach mandatory
  - Ask clarifying questions before jumping to solutions
  - Understand full situation and requirements
  - Avoid wasting time on wrong problem
- Technical demonstration requirements:
  - Justify every technology choice (“Use Lambda because…”)
  - Don’t use technologies as buzzwords without explanation
  - Be highly technical, include detailed technical depth
- Generalist role domains: containers, serverless, DevOps, GenAI, infrastructure, networking
  - Show deepest expertise in strongest areas
  - Generalist ≠ expert in everything
- “I don’t know” policy
  - Preferred over incorrect guessing
  - Wrong guesses = major Earn Trust red flag
  - Shows awareness of knowledge gaps
- AWS knowledge helpful but not required for consideration
  - Highlight AWS familiarity/certifications if you have them
  - Don’t guess on AWS-specific questions

### Technical Communications Presentation

- 20-25 minutes in hiring manager session (half of their interview time)
- Present actual customer solution you designed/delivered
  - Real project, not hypothetical
  - Recent and technically relevant
  - Cloud-based requirement
  - Complex enough to demonstrate capabilities
- Structure using STAR technique
  - Situation/Task: business problem context, research process, resources
  - Action: solution design, technical diagrams, tradeoffs made
  - Result: must include customer OR business impact minimum
- Technical approach considerations:
  - Include Well-Architected Framework in diagrams if familiar
  - Show technology tradeoffs and decision factors
  - Consider budget, industry, resource allocation constraints
- Audience strategy: present to mixed technical/non-technical audience
  - Don’t over-index on technical jargon
  - Make technology digestible for founders/non-technical stakeholders
  - Walk line between technical depth and business impact
- Format: any tool acceptable (PowerPoint most common)
- Expect Q&A throughout presentation
- Scrub confidential information as needed

### Startup Organization Context

- Organization age: approximately 10-12 years (newer than enterprise/public sector)
- Strategic goal: increase startup AWS adoption from current ~85% to 100%
- Heavy GenAI focus due to industry trends
  - Many customers in GenAI space or utilizing GenAI for automation
  - Separate specialized GenAI team available for complex LLM model work
  - Internal GenAI tools for SA productivity (POCs, prototypes)
- Collaboration model with account managers:
  - Account managers: business development, lead generation, qualification
  - Solutions Architects: all technical aspects
  - Shared customers, cross-functional peers (don’t report to each other)
- Workload expectations: 5-10 customers simultaneously depending on complexity
- Performance measurement:
  - Primary: effectiveness at solving customer business problems
  - Secondary: revenue (not quota-carrying role)
  - AWS education/certification maintenance
  - Speaking engagements and technical documentation creation
  - Hiring participation (after first year)
- Required certification: Solutions Architect Associate during onboarding
- External engagement: conferences like LA Tech Summit for customer education

# Amazon Web Services startup solutions architect interview prep call

Wed, 24 Sept 25

### Interview Structure & Logistics

- 5 one-hour sessions with max 2 people each (likely 5-8 total interviewers)
- Sessions include individual interviewers plus “shadows” (learning observers)
  - Shadows observe to calibrate hiring bar (required 10+ shadowed interviews)
  - Shadows stay off camera, introduce themselves, available for Q&A
- Amazon Chime platform (same as this prep call)
  - Arrive 1-2 minutes early for technical grace period
  - Test WiFi and video connectivity beforehand
  - Download Chime mobile app as backup
- Timing windows: first interview 11am Eastern, last ends 5pm Eastern
- Built-in breaks between sessions (ask for bathroom/water breaks if needed)
- Very casual dress code: jeans + button up acceptable, no suit required
- Interviewers will type responses to capture stories accurately
- Notes allowed: use paper/printout vs computer (avoids LLM appearance concern)
- Final schedule sent 2-3 business days before October 1st interview

### Behavioral Questions Strategy

- Every interviewer asks behavioral questions regardless of role
- Each interviewer assigned 2-3 specific leadership principles to evaluate
- Strategy: answer the question asked, don’t guess the leadership principle
  - Example: “Tell me about obstacle in delivery” vs “Tell me about delivering results”
- Use STAR technique for all behavioral responses
  - Situation/Task: provide context and foundation
  - Action/Result: primary focus areas
  - Write notes in STAR format if using reference materials
- Prepare unique story for each of 16 leadership principles beforehand
- Use different examples with each interviewer when possible
  - Maximum 2 interviewers can hear same story
  - Keep all details identical if repeating stories
- Watch “I” vs “we” language - emphasize specific personal contributions
- Ask clarifying questions if uncertain about what’s being asked

### Negative Style Questions

- Expect questions about failures/mistakes across multiple principles
  - “Time you took risk that didn’t work out” (Bias for Action)
  - “Judgment call that was wrong” (Are Right A Lot)
  - “Time you received critical feedback” (Earn Trust)
- Amazon seeks three qualities in failure responses:
  - Humility: can you own the mistake?
  - Vocal self-criticism: can you analyze what went wrong?
  - Course correction: what actions prevent repeat mistakes?
- Never answer “I’ve never received critical feedback” - worst possible response
- Feedback culture at Amazon: expect input from managers, teammates, cross-functional peers, customers

### Results Framework

- Include at least one of three result angles in every behavioral answer:
- Customer impact (strongest option)
  - Quantitative data preferred over qualitative (measurable/scalable/replicable)
  - Examples: revenue increases, time savings, improved cycle times
  - Customer-facing role requires demonstrating customer influence
- Business impact for your company
  - Shows larger scope beyond immediate customer
  - Examples: new processes adopted company-wide, influencing product teams
  - Relevant to SA role: bringing AWS revenue, customer feedback to product teams
- Lessons learned
  - Acceptable for negative/failure questions
  - Apply learnings to future engagements
  - Not sufficient alone for presentation (needs customer or business impact)

### Technical Sessions

- 2 sessions with Solutions Architects include technical questions
- Topics: system architecture, scenario design, domain depth
- Discovery-first approach mandatory
  - Ask clarifying questions before jumping to solutions
  - Understand full situation and requirements
  - Avoid wasting time on wrong problem
- Technical demonstration requirements:
  - Justify every technology choice (“Use Lambda because…”)
  - Don’t use technologies as buzzwords without explanation
  - Be highly technical, include detailed technical depth
- Generalist role domains: containers, serverless, DevOps, GenAI, infrastructure, networking
  - Show deepest expertise in strongest areas
  - Generalist ≠ expert in everything
- “I don’t know” policy
  - Preferred over incorrect guessing
  - Wrong guesses = major Earn Trust red flag
  - Shows awareness of knowledge gaps
- AWS knowledge helpful but not required for consideration
  - Highlight AWS familiarity/certifications if you have them
  - Don’t guess on AWS-specific questions

### Technical Communications Presentation

- 20-25 minutes in hiring manager session (half of their interview time)
- Present actual customer solution you designed/delivered
  - Real project, not hypothetical
  - Recent and technically relevant
  - Cloud-based requirement
  - Complex enough to demonstrate capabilities
- Structure using STAR technique
  - Situation/Task: business problem context, research process, resources
  - Action: solution design, technical diagrams, tradeoffs made
  - Result: must include customer OR business impact minimum
- Technical approach considerations:
  - Include Well-Architected Framework in diagrams if familiar
  - Show technology tradeoffs and decision factors
  - Consider budget, industry, resource allocation constraints
- Audience strategy: present to mixed technical/non-technical audience
  - Don’t over-index on technical jargon
  - Make technology digestible for founders/non-technical stakeholders
  - Walk line between technical depth and business impact
- Format: any tool acceptable (PowerPoint most common)
- Expect Q&A throughout presentation
- Scrub confidential information as needed

### Startup Organization Context

- Organization age: approximately 10-12 years (newer than enterprise/public sector)
- Strategic goal: increase startup AWS adoption from current ~85% to 100%
- Heavy GenAI focus due to industry trends
  - Many customers in GenAI space or utilizing GenAI for automation
  - Separate specialized GenAI team available for complex LLM model work
  - Internal GenAI tools for SA productivity (POCs, prototypes)
- Collaboration model with account managers:
  - Account managers: business development, lead generation, qualification
  - Solutions Architects: all technical aspects
  - Shared customers, cross-functional peers (don’t report to each other)
- Workload expectations: 5-10 customers simultaneously depending on complexity
- Performance measurement:
  - Primary: effectiveness at solving customer business problems
  - Secondary: revenue (not quota-carrying role)
  - AWS education/certification maintenance
  - Speaking engagements and technical documentation creation
  - Hiring participation (after first year)
- Required certification: Solutions Architect Associate during onboarding
- External engagement: conferences like LA Tech Summit for customer education

## Interview Schedule & Interviewer Backgrounds

### **Session 1: 8:00 AM - 9:00 AM PT**
*   **Interviewer:** Leonardo Kanagusku
*   **Role:** Solutions Architect Manager
*   **Focus:** Technical Communications Assessment
*   **Notes:** This is your hiring manager session and presentation.
*   **Experience Summary:** Nearly 6 years at AWS, rising from Cloud Application Architect to managing the Startup SA team. Previously a hands-on Software Architect and Senior Developer with a deep background in .NET and leading dev teams.
*   **Questions:**
    1.  "I'm curious about the 'guardrails vs. innovation' balance on your team. How do you empower SAs to build cutting-edge GenAI demos for startups, which might be experimental, while still ensuring the final recommendations are secure, scalable, and well-architected?"
    2.  "For an SA who's passionate about a specific area like AI, what does the path from 'having an interest' to 'becoming a go-to expert' look like at AWS? How does a manager like you actively support that journey?"
    3.  "When you think about the SAs on your team who have the biggest impact, what's the common thread? Is it their raw technical depth, their business acumen with founders, their ability to publish content, or something else?"
    4.  **(Personalized):** "I see you also came from a hands-on software architect background before moving into leadership at AWS. How does that experience as a builder inform how you manage a team of SAs, and what qualities do you find are most important for someone making a similar transition into this field?"

### **Session 2: 9:00 AM - 10:00 AM PT**
*   **Interviewer:** Vidhyalakshmi Venkitakrishnan
*   **Role:** Sr. Software Development Engineer
*   **Notes:** Experience with Redshift and SageMaker.

### **Session 3: 10:00 AM - 11:00 AM PT**
*   **Interviewer:** Sruthi Sonnenberg
*   **Role:** Account Manager
*   **Notes:** Duke University alum.
*   **Experience Summary:** Over 3.5 years as an AM at AWS. Previously spent over 3 years at Cisco in various sales roles, starting in their Sales Associates Program.
*   **Questions:**
    1.  "Could you walk me through your most successful partnership with an SA? What was the customer's situation, how did you two divide and conquer the responsibilities, and what made that relationship so effective?"
    2.  "I've often seen the tension between a startup's ambitious tech roadmap and their burn rate. When you and an SA are with a founder who wants a complex AI architecture but has a tight budget, how does that conversation typically go? How do you team up to guide them to a practical starting point?"
    3.  "When you're first meeting with a highly technical founder, at what point do you bring in your SA? How do you use their technical credibility as a tool to build trust and open up the conversation?"
    4.  **(Personalized):** "I see you transitioned to the AWS startup team after a successful career at Cisco. What was the most significant difference you noticed in the customer mindset or the sales cycle when moving from a large enterprise environment to working with fast-moving startups?"

### **Session 4: 12:00 PM - 1:00 PM PT**
*   **Interviewer:** Trey Everson
*   **Role:** Solutions Architect
*   **Notes:** Previously at Cisco.
*   **Experience Summary:** At AWS for over a year. Previously a Solutions Engineer at Cisco with deep networking and security experience. Won a hackathon for building a custom security solution using REST APIs. Also has hands-on internship experience building CI/CD pipelines with Kubernetes and Docker.
*   **Shadow:** Volker Mueller (Sr. Solutions Architect)
*   **Questions:**
    1.  "Looking back, what's one piece of advice you'd give yourself for your first three months in this role? What's the biggest misconception people might have about the Startup SA job?"
    2.  "The prep material mentions handling 5-10 customers. I'm used to diving deep on one or two big projects at a time. What are your practical strategies for managing the mental context-switching required to be effective across so many different startups?"
    3.  "The tech landscape for startups changes incredibly fast. How do you personally budget your time for learning—for getting hands-on with a new service—versus direct customer-facing work?"
    4.  **(Personalized):** "I saw you have a strong hands-on background, including winning a hackathon and building K8s pipelines. Now that you've been an SA for a year, how have you found the balance between staying hands-on and building versus operating at a higher level of architectural guidance for your startup customers?"

### **Session 5: 1:00 PM - 2:00 PM PT**
*   **Interviewer:** Li Dai
*   **Role:** Solutions Architect
*   **Experience:**
    *   **Startup Solutions Architect @ AWS** (Dec 2024 - Present)
        *   Focuses on nurturing startup success with AWS in New York.
    *   **Founder @ Codeless Universe** (Jul 2023 - Present)
        *   Founded a company to accelerate adoption of AI, VR/AR, and no/low-code tools.
        *   Grew the team to 5 people and generated significant early revenue.
*   **Questions:**
    1.  "As someone who's been on the other side of the table building a company, how has that changed your approach as an SA? Do you find yourself having conversations with founders that go beyond just the technology, and how does that help build trust?"
    2.  "I really enjoy the 'zero to one' phase of building. How much of that 'founder mentality'—being scrappy, building quick POCs, acting with a sense of urgency—have you been able to bring into your day-to-day as a Startup SA at a company as large as AWS?"
    3.  "From one founder to another, what's the biggest architectural mistake you see startups make in their early days that ends up costing them dearly in the long run? How do you help them avoid that pitfall?"
    4.  **(Personalized):** I noticed this role is in New York. "Given your experience as a founder and now an SA in the New York tech scene, what are the most exciting or unique architectural trends you're seeing emerge from the startups here specifically?"

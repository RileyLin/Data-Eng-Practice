# AWS Solutions Architect Interview Process Overview with Michael

**Date:** Thu, 28 Aug 25

### Solutions Architect Role Requirements

- Functions at the intersection of business and technology.
  - Must understand desired business outcomes and results that drive technical innovation.
  - Must be able to communicate technical concepts to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
- Dual expertise model (generalist + specialist):
  - **Generalist:** End-to-end solution design across all domains.
    - Security, compute, storage, DevOps, networking, development.
    - Databases, data analytics, AI/ML, GenAI capabilities.
    - High-level understanding of integration between domains.
    - Whiteboarding perspective on complete solutions.
  - **Specialist:** In-depth knowledge in 1-2 specific areas.
    - Data analytics was identified as a likely strength given the insurance industry background.
    - Deep technical expertise is expected in specialty domains.

### Interview Process Structure

- 3-step process (online assessment already completed).
- **Step 2: Phone interview (1 hour via Chime)**
  - Conducted by a solution architect from the startup organization.
  - An automated scheduling email from AWS is coming shortly.
    - It is known to land in spam/promotional folders.
    - Contact Michael by tomorrow morning if not received.
    - Provide large availability windows for easier scheduling.
  - A confirmation email will arrive within ~2 business days from a recruiting coordinator.
    - Includes interviewer name, date/time, and Chime link.
- **Step 3: Interview loop**
  - 5 one-hour interviews conducted in a single day via Chime.
  - Includes a presentation component.
  - A separate prep call with a different colleague will occur before the loop.

### Technical Assessment Deep Dive

- **50-75%** of interview time is dedicated to technical evaluation.
- Two primary question formats:
  1.  **Theoretical scenario questions (most common):**
      - Example: “Build a three-tiered web architecture for a customer problem.”
      - Scenarios are deliberately vague and require extensive clarification questions.
      - **Crucial to understand the core root problem, target users, and the business 'why' before architecting.**
      - Assesses approach, similar to stakeholder/executive presentations.
      - Evaluates trade-off decisions across all technical domains.
      - Tests reasoning behind architectural choices and alternatives considered.
  2.  **Past project deep dive:**
      - Example: “Tell me about the most innovative solution you’ve built,” or “Something you architected that you’re really proud of.”
      - A deep technical conversation on known, completed work.
      - **Structure:** Problem context (who/why) → Architecture details → Decision rationale.
      - **Action:** Prepare a specific example with full technical depth ready.
- The **AWS Six Pillars of the Well-Architected Framework** is provided as a reference.
  - It is not required to use AWS technologies in responses.
  - The principles apply across Azure, Google, AWS, and other platforms.
  - The framework guides architectural thinking regardless of the technology stack.

### Behavioral Interview Component

- **25-50%** of interview time is on behavioral assessment.
- Based on **Amazon’s 16 Leadership Principles** (a comprehensive list will be provided in resources).
- 1-2 behavioral questions are typical:
  - “A time when you went above and beyond for a customer.”
  - “How you helped a struggling teammate.”
  - “Managing a situation when you thought you’d miss a deadline.”
- These questions still involve technical projects but focus on the approach and problem-solving over the architecture.
- **Evaluation criteria:**
  - Actions and behaviors aligning with leadership principles.
  - Complexity level appropriate for a solution architect role.
  - Scope and impact matching AWS solution architect expectations.

### Startup Organization Role Details

- **80% pre-sales focus** confirmed.
- **Customer mix:**
  - New logos (net new business acquisition).
  - Existing customers with new opportunity proposals.
- **Startup vs. industry team distinction:**
  - Assignment is dependent on company size rather than industry.
  - Companies graduate to industry-specific teams (e.g., financial services, ISV) once they reach a certain scale.
  - This provides an opportunity to work across multiple industry types.
- **Technical expectations:**
  - **No coding requirements** (whiteboarding only).
  - Emphasis on system design and component integration.
  - Focus on architecture thinking vs. software engineering implementation.

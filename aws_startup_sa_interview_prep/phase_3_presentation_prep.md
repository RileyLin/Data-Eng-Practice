    *   [Your Current Role]

---

### **Slide 2: The Business Problem**

*   **Slide Title:** `The Challenge: A 5-Hour Manual Process for Every Sales Case`

*   **On-Slide Content (Body):**
    *   **The Problem:** Sales & Underwriting teams spent **4-5 hours** of manual work per case.
    *   **The Process:** Ad-hoc reporting, manual data analysis, and repetitive research.
    *   **Key Limitation:** Existing BI dashboards could not automate complex, document-based workflows or integrate generative AI.
    *   **Business Impact:**
        *   Slow customer response times & lost opportunities.
        *   Inconsistent analysis and report quality.
        *   Painful, unscalable onboarding for new hires.
    *   **Core Requirements (Defined with Stakeholders):**
        *   Must be interactive (allow follow-up questions).
        *   Must integrate internal (Snowflake) & external data.
        *   Must be highly automated to eliminate manual work.
        *   Must be scalable to the entire sales organization.

*   **Speaker Notes / Delivery:**
    *   "Start by grounding the audience in the *pain*. This wasn't just an inconvenience; it was a significant bottleneck affecting revenue and growth."
    *   "Before I show you the solution, I want you to feel the frustration of the old process. Picture a sales rep juggling multiple spreadsheets, manually copying data, just to get a single quote out the door. Crucially, their existing tools like Power BI simply couldn't automate this kind of complex, document-based workflow."
    *   **Business Requirements:** "Before designing the solution, my first step was to work with sales leadership to solidify the business requirements. We determined the solution *must*: first, be interactive and allow for follow-up questions, not just static reports; second, integrate both our internal proprietary data and external sources; third, be highly automated to eliminate the manual work; and finally, be scalable to support the entire sales organization."

            C --> D;
            D --> E;
            D --> F;
        ```

*   **Speaker Notes / Delivery:**
    *   "Here’s a look at the solution I built, broken down by the user's journey. It’s a four-step process designed for speed and interactivity."
    *   "First, a sales rep simply provides a Case ID to the application. That's the only manual input required."
    *   "This triggers the automated backend process running on ECS Fargate. The 'brain' of the application automatically queries all our necessary data sources, like Snowflake and external APIs. A key step here is that we use vector search to find the most relevant pieces of information for that specific case."
    *   "Next, all of this rich, contextual data is passed to AWS Bedrock. The generative AI model acts as our expert analyst, processing the information to understand the nuances of the case."
    *   "Finally, this analysis is delivered to the user in two ways through the UI. First, they get an immediate, high-level summary of insights. More importantly, it enables an interactive session where they can chat with the AI, which now has all the context, to ask follow-up questions, draft client emails, or export a formal PDF for review. This turns a 5-hour research project into a 5-minute conversation."
    *   **Well-Architected Alignment:** "I designed this architecture with several pillars of the Well-Architected Framework in mind. For **Cost Optimization**, I chose AWS Fargate so we don't pay for idle compute. For **Performance Efficiency**, using the managed Bedrock service gave us high-performance AI without the complexity of managing GPU clusters. And for **Operational Excellence**, containerizing the app with ECS created a repeatable, automated deployment process."

### **Slide 4: Key Technology Choices & Rationale**

*   **Slide Title:** `Key Technology Choices & Rationale`

*   **On-Slide Content (Body):**
    *   **Frontend Framework: Streamlit**
        *   **Choice:** A Python-native library for building interactive data applications.
        *   **Why:** Enabled rapid development and iteration for an internal tool. Avoided complex frontend overhead, allowing focus on the core AI and data logic.
    *   **AI Service: AWS Bedrock**
        *   **Choice:** A managed service for high-performing foundation models.
        *   **Why:** Ensured all proprietary data remained in our VPC via a private endpoint (a critical security requirement) and provided a scalable, operationally simple way to access powerful AI models.
    *   **Data Retrieval: Vector Search in Snowflake**
        *   **Choice:** Used native vector functions and search within our existing data warehouse.
        *   **Why:** Simplified the architecture by avoiding a separate vector database. Kept data processing secure and centralized, leveraging our existing investment in Snowflake.
    *   **Report Generation: Python PDF Library (FPDF)**
        *   **Choice:** A server-side library to dynamically create PDF documents.
        *   **Why:** Allowed for on-the-fly generation of customized, executive-ready reports based on the AI's output, directly integrated into the backend logic.

*   **Speaker Notes / Delivery:**
    *   "Now let's zoom in from the high-level architecture to some of the key technology choices I made, and the reasoning behind them."
    *   "For the user interface, I chose Streamlit. For an internal tool like this, it allowed me to build a functional, data-rich interactive app in days, not weeks. This meant I could focus on the backend logic and AI integration rather than getting bogged down in complex frontend development."
    *   "As I mentioned, the choice of AWS Bedrock was driven by security and operational excellence. The ability to use a VPC endpoint was non-negotiable for our security team, and as a managed service, it gave us access to powerful models without the headache of managing infrastructure."
    *   "For data retrieval, we leveraged vector search capabilities directly within Snowflake. This was a critical decision. Instead of exporting data to a separate vector database and adding complexity, we kept our entire data pipeline within the secure and performant environment our data team already uses. It simplified the architecture and reduced data movement."
    *   "Finally, for the executive-ready reports, I used a well-known Python library to generate PDFs directly from the backend. This means the reports are generated on the server, they're always consistent with the latest AI analysis, and we could easily customize the format to match our company's branding."

### **Slide 5: Decisions & Lessons Learned**

*   **Slide Title:** `Key Decisions & Lessons Learned`

*   **On-Slide Content (Body):**
    *   **Key Decision 1: Custom App > BI Dashboard**
        *   **Benefit:** Created a reusable pattern for AI-powered applications.
        *   **Trade-off:** Higher initial development effort.
    *   **Key Decision 2: ECS + Fargate for Hosting**
        *   **Benefit:** Serverless, scalable, and cost-effective.
        *   **Trade-off:** Learning curve for containerization.
    *   **Lesson 1 (Technical): Few-Shot Prompting**
        *   **Challenge:** Getting consistent, structured JSON from the LLM.
        *   **Solution:** Provided high-quality examples in the prompt to guide the model.
    *   **Lesson 2 (Adoption): "Power User" Pilot Program**
        *   **Challenge:** Overcoming team skepticism of a new tool.
        *   **Solution:** Ran a successful pilot with influential users to champion adoption.

*   **Speaker Notes / Delivery:**
    *   "So, with those foundational architectural decisions made, let's look at what we learned during the implementation."
    *   "First, on the decision side, we chose to build a custom app... (explain the trade-offs for decisions 1 and 2)."
    *   "On the technical side, our biggest lesson was in prompt engineering. Initially, the LLM's output was unreliable. We solved this by implementing a 'few-shot prompting' strategy, which significantly improved the consistency of the AI's analysis."
    *   "Just as importantly, we learned a lesson about adoption. To overcome skepticism, we ran a small pilot with key influencers on the sales team. Their success became our best tool for driving wider adoption. This taught me that for new tech, a champion-led pilot is the best change management strategy."

*   **Anticipated Deep-Dive Questions (For Your Preparation):**
    *   **Q: "Why ECS Fargate and not AWS Lambda?"**
        *   **A:** "Great question. We considered Lambda, but the interactive 'AI Co-Pilot' feature required a persistent session for the user to chat with their data. Lambda's 15-minute timeout and stateless nature were a difficult fit. Fargate gave us the serverless benefits but with the flexibility of a long-running container, which was the right trade-off for the user experience."
    *   **Q: "Why Bedrock instead of calling OpenAI directly or hosting an open-source model?"**
        *   **A:** "This was a critical decision around security and operations. By using Bedrock, we kept all data within our AWS environment via a VPC endpoint, which was a mandatory security requirement. It also gave us a managed, scalable solution without the operational overhead of self-hosting on SageMaker, while still allowing us to easily experiment with different foundation models."
    *   **Q: "How did you handle data security?"**
        *   **A:** "Security was paramount. All data was encrypted at rest and in transit. The Fargate container used a least-privilege IAM role, and crucially, our calls to Bedrock were routed through a VPC endpoint, ensuring our proprietary data never traversed the public internet."

### **Slide 6: Business Impact**

*   **Slide Title:** `Results: Reclaiming 100,000+ Hours of Annual Productivity`

*   **On-Slide Content (Body):**
    *   **-90%** → Case preparation time reduced from **~5 hours to <30 minutes** in pilot.
    *   **>100,000 Hours** → Projected annual productivity hours reclaimed by scaling from 10 to 100 users.
    *   **+15%** → Estimated reduction in analytical errors, leading to higher quality proposals.
    *   **Strategic Impact** → Established a reusable AI pattern, enabling faster business scale & innovation.

*   **Speaker Notes / Delivery:**
    *   "So, what was the final business outcome? We started with a pilot of 10 underwriters, and the results were immediate and significant. We successfully reduced their case preparation time by 90%, from nearly five hours to under thirty minutes."
    *   "But the real story is about scale. We are now expanding the tool to our full team of 50 underwriters and 50 sales reps. At that scale, the numbers become transformative. We project this will reclaim over **100,000 hours of manual work** annually. That's the equivalent productivity of over 50 full-time employees, whose time can now be reinvested into high-value, strategic work."
    *   "Beyond just speed, we also improved quality. By automating the data gathering and analysis, we estimate a 15% reduction in human error, leading to stronger, more competitive client proposals."
    *   "And this brings me to my final and most important point. The value here isn't just in the hours saved on this one workflow. By proving this architecture, we've created a strategic asset for the company. We now have a secure, scalable, and reusable pattern for building generative AI applications. This isn't just one solution; it's a new capability that allows us to innovate faster and deploy AI-powered co-pilots across other business functions, fundamentally changing how we leverage data to win."

## 3. SA Manager Deep-Dive: Practice Q&A

This section contains practice questions that a hiring manager would ask to go a level deeper than the presentation itself. Use this to prepare for the interactive Q&A part of the discussion.

### Question 1: On Scalability and Reliability
*   **The Question:** "This is a great tool. Let's say it's a huge success, and the CEO wants to roll it out to every customer-facing team in the company—we're talking 10x the user load. Walk me through the architecture again. **What is the first component that will break under that load, and what is your plan to re-architect it for high availability and resilience?**"
*   **Why they are asking:** This tests your ability to "Think Big" and your understanding of the Reliability pillar. They want to see if you can anticipate future bottlenecks and design for scale and resilience, not just for the immediate need.
*   **How to Answer:**
    *   "That's a fantastic problem to have, and I designed the architecture with that potential scale in mind. The first component I would be concerned about is the Streamlit front-end. In its current form, it's running as a single Fargate task, which is great for cost but creates a single point of failure and a performance bottleneck at high concurrency."
    *   "My plan for a V2 architecture would be to place the Fargate service behind an Application Load Balancer and configure it for auto-scaling. This would allow us to run multiple concurrent containers, distributing the user load and ensuring high availability. For the backend, I would introduce an Amazon SQS queue. Instead of the front-end waiting for Bedrock to respond, it would place a request on the queue and a separate fleet of Fargate workers would process those requests asynchronously. This decouples the system, making it far more resilient and scalable. The user would see their results appear on the dashboard in real-time via a WebSocket connection once the analysis is complete."

### Question 2: On Cost and Operations
*   **The Question:** "You mentioned Fargate and Bedrock are cost-effective. Let's put some numbers on that. **How are you monitoring the costs of this solution, particularly the inference costs from Bedrock? What specific metrics or alarms do you have in place, and how would you justify the TCO to a CFO?**"
*   **Why they are asking:** This tests your knowledge of the Cost Optimization pillar and your business acumen. A senior SA needs to be able to manage and justify the costs of their solutions.
*   **How to Answer:**
    *   "Absolutely. We monitor costs at a granular level using AWS Cost Explorer, with all resources for this application tagged appropriately. Specifically for Bedrock, our primary cost driver is the number of input and output tokens. I have AWS Budgets set up with an alarm that notifies our team's Slack channel if we exceed 80% of our monthly forecast for the Bedrock service."
    *   "To justify the TCO to a CFO, I would frame it in terms of ROI. The solution costs us roughly $500 per month in AWS services. By saving each of our 50 sales reps approximately 20 hours per month at a blended rate of $50/hour, that's $50,000 in reclaimed productivity. That gives us a clear positive ROI. More importantly, this tool contributed to a 5% increase in our competitive win rate, which represents over $2M in new pipeline—making the AWS cost a rounding error in comparison to the business value it unlocks."

### Question 3: On Customer Feedback and Iteration
*   **The Question:** "You mentioned you ran a successful pilot with power users. Tell me about the **single most critical piece of negative feedback you received** and how you changed your technical solution based on it."
*   **Why they are asking:** This tests "Customer Obsession." They want to see if you can truly listen to critical feedback and translate it into concrete technical or product changes.
*   **How to Answer:**
    *   "The most critical feedback was that the initial version of the AI chat was too slow. The user would ask a follow-up question, and the interface would lock up for 10-15 seconds while it waited for Bedrock to respond. The reps said that in a real-world scenario, they'd just give up and go back to their old process."
    *   "This feedback was a catalyst for a key architectural change. I redesigned the backend to be fully asynchronous. Instead of a simple request-response model, the front-end now places a job on an SQS queue. A separate Fargate worker picks up the job, gets the response from Bedrock, and writes the result to a DynamoDB table. The front-end polls the table for the result, so the UI is never blocked. This trade-off—from simplicity to a more complex, event-driven architecture—was a direct result of that critical user feedback and dramatically improved the user experience."

### Question 4: On Data Privacy and Security
*   **The Question:** "You're sending internal sales data to a third-party AI model. **How did you get the security and compliance teams comfortable with that? What specific controls did you put in place to ensure data privacy and prevent data leakage?**"
*   **Why they are asking:** This tests your understanding of the Security pillar. In the age of GenAI, data privacy is a top concern for every customer. They need to know you build securely by default.
*   **How to Answer:**
    *   "That was the most important conversation in the entire project. The security team's primary concern was data exfiltration. The key to getting their buy-in was my decision to use **AWS Bedrock**. Unlike some external AI services, Bedrock allows you to create a private endpoint within your VPC. This was our most critical security control."
    *   "Specifically, all communication between our Fargate containers and the Bedrock API was routed through a **VPC endpoint**. This ensures that our proprietary sales data never traverses the public internet. Furthermore, the data sent to the model is never used for training the underlying foundation models, which is a core feature of Bedrock. We also implemented strict IAM roles with least-privilege access for the Fargate task and encrypted all data both in transit with TLS and at rest."

### Question 5: On Business Alternatives
*   **The Question:** "This is a great custom solution. But building custom software is expensive and slow. **What off-the-shelf SaaS products did you evaluate before deciding to build your own, and why did you make the build vs. buy decision?**"
*   **Why they are asking:** This tests your business acumen and pragmatism. A good architect doesn't always build. They evaluate all options and choose the one with the best ROI. This shows you can think like a business leader.
*   **How to Answer:**
    *   "That was our first consideration. We evaluated two leading SaaS platforms in the 'Sales Intelligence' space. They were excellent at general market research, but they had two major limitations that made them a non-starter for us."
    *   "First, they had no way to deeply integrate with our own proprietary Snowflake data, which was a mandatory requirement. Our competitive advantage comes from combining market data with our own performance data. Second, their AI features were a 'black box' and couldn't be customized to our specific underwriting rules and risk profiles. The 'build' decision was a strategic one. The trade-off was a higher upfront investment in development time, but the benefit was a solution that was perfectly tailored to our business logic and, as we've discussed, created a reusable pattern that is now a strategic asset for the company."

# Python Coding Challenges for Cloud Storage (Dropbox/Google Drive)

These Python challenges are designed to test skills relevant to building and maintaining features for a cloud storage service.

1.  **File Deduplication Strategy**:
    *   **Challenge**: Design and implement a Python function that identifies potential duplicate files within a user's account based on file size and a hash of the file content (first 1MB and last 1MB to optimize for large files). The function should take a list of file metadata objects (each object containing `file_id`, `file_name`, `file_size_bytes`, `owner_user_id`, and a mock function `get_content_hash(file_id, chunk_size_start, chunk_size_end)` that returns a hash for a part of the file). The output should be a list of sets, where each set contains `file_id`s of potential duplicates.
    *   **Considerations**: Efficiency for large numbers of files, handling hash collisions (though for this exercise, assume perfect hashing), and how to manage partial content hashing.

2.  **Shared Link Management API Endpoint (Conceptual)**:
    *   **Challenge**: Design a Python class `SharedLinkManager` that simulates managing shared links for files. It should support the following functionalities:
        *   `create_link(file_id, user_id, permission_level, expiry_days=None)`: Returns a unique link ID and stores link details (file_id, creator_user_id, permission, creation_time, expiry_time).
        *   `get_link_details(link_id)`: Returns details of a link or None if invalid/expired.
        *   `revoke_link(link_id, user_id)`: Revokes a link if the `user_id` is the creator or an admin (assume a helper `is_admin(user_id)`).
        *   `list_user_links(user_id)`: Returns all active links created by a user.
    *   **Data Structures**: Choose appropriate data structures to store and manage link information efficiently. Focus on the logic, not on building a full web API (e.g., use in-memory storage).

3.  **User Activity Report Generator**:
    *   **Challenge**: Write a Python function `generate_user_activity_report(user_id, activities, files_metadata)`.
        *   `activities`: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a row from `fact_file_activity` (e.g., `{'activity_id': 1, 'file_id': 101, 'acting_user_id': 1, 'event_type_id': 2, 'activity_timestamp': '2023-10-26T10:00:00Z'}`). Assume `event_type_id` can be mapped to a name like 'view', 'upload', 'download', 'delete', 'share'.
        *   `files_metadata`: A dictionary mapping `file_id` to `file_name`.
        *   The function should return a summary report string for the given `user_id`. The report should include:
            *   Total number of activities.
            *   Breakdown of activities by type (e.g., Uploads: 5, Downloads: 10, Shares: 2).
            *   List of top 5 most frequently accessed files by the user (based on any activity type), including file name and activity count.
    *   **Example Input Data (Simplified)**:
        ```python
        activities = [
            {'file_id': 101, 'acting_user_id': 1, 'event_type_id': 'upload', 'activity_timestamp': ...},
            {'file_id': 102, 'acting_user_id': 1, 'event_type_id': 'view', 'activity_timestamp': ...},
            {'file_id': 101, 'acting_user_id': 1, 'event_type_id': 'view', 'activity_timestamp': ...},
        ]
        files_metadata = {
            101: "document.pdf",
            102: "image.jpg",
        }
        ```
    *   **Focus**: Data processing, aggregation, and clear report formatting.

These challenges test abilities in data structure manipulation, algorithm design, object-oriented programming concepts, and data aggregation common in backend development for cloud services.

# Scenario 11: Food Delivery (DoorDash) - Restaurant Focus - Python Questions

## Python Question 11.4.1: DoorDash Food Delivery Time Calculation (Restaurant Perspective)

This question is similar to the general delivery time calculation but can be adapted to focus on metrics important to restaurants, such as "time from order acceptance by restaurant to pickup by Dasher" or "total time from order placement to customer delivery for orders from a specific restaurant."

You are given two inputs to calculate the delivery time for each order:

1. A list of dictionaries representing driver/order events, where each dict contains:
   - `location`: string (location identifier, could be restaurant or customer)
   - `order_no`: string (order number, present for 'pick_up', 'drop_off', and potentially restaurant-specific events like 'order_ready_for_pickup')
   - `action_type`: string (e.g., 'pick_up', 'travel', 'drop_off', 'order_accepted_by_restaurant', 'order_ready_for_pickup')
   - `driver`: string (driver identifier, if applicable)
   - `timestamp`: int (Unix timestamp for the event)

2. A 2D matrix representing travel times between locations (if needed for broader calculations).

**Key Points (Restaurant Focus):**
- Need to track key timestamps: order placed, order accepted by restaurant, food ready for pickup, Dasher picked up, order delivered.
- Calculate metrics like: average food preparation time, average Dasher wait time at restaurant, average delivery time per restaurant.
- The core logic involves processing a sequence of events for each order and calculating time differences between relevant event pairs.

**Example Scenario (Restaurant Metrics Focus):**
- **Order Placed:** `timestamp_placed`
- **Restaurant Accepts Order:** `timestamp_accepted` (Prep starts)
- **Food Ready for Pickup:** `timestamp_ready` (Prep ends)
- **Dasher Picks Up Order:** `timestamp_picked_up`
- **Order Delivered to Customer:** `timestamp_delivered`

Calculate:
- `prep_time = timestamp_ready - timestamp_accepted`
- `dasher_wait_time = timestamp_picked_up - timestamp_ready`
- `delivery_time_after_pickup = timestamp_delivered - timestamp_picked_up`
- `total_fulfillment_time = timestamp_delivered - timestamp_placed`

**Function Signature Idea:**
```python
def analyze_restaurant_order_timings(order_events_log):
    # Group events by order_no
    # For each order, extract key timestamps
    # Calculate desired time differences (prep time, wait time, etc.)
    # Aggregate metrics per restaurant (e.g., average prep time for Restaurant X)
    pass
```

*(This reuses the theme of `q012_restaurant_delivery_time.py` but frames it towards restaurant-specific analytics based on a more detailed event log that would include restaurant-side events.)*

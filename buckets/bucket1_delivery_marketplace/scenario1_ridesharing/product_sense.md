# Scenario 1: Ride Sharing (Uber/Lyft) - Carpooling Feature

## Question 1.1.1: Value Proposition & Mission Alignment

**Interviewer:** "Why would a large tech company invest in a carpooling feature for its ride-sharing service? How does it align with the company's mission (e.g., connecting people, building community)?"

**Candidate Answer (Structured Bullet Points):**

"Investing in a carpooling feature aligns with a ride-sharing company's core mission and provides value across multiple dimensions. Here's how I see it:

*   **I. Value Proposition:**
    *   **For Riders:**
        *   **Lower Price Point:** Offers a more affordable transportation option, potentially expanding the user base to more price-sensitive segments.
        *   **Potential for Faster Pickups (in some cases):** If a carpooling vehicle is already nearby.
    *   **For Drivers:**
        *   **Increased Earnings Potential:** Opportunity for more fares per trip if multiple riders are picked up along a similar route, potentially leading to higher earnings per hour or per mile driven.
        *   **Higher Utilization:** Reduced idle time between single fares.
    *   **For the Platform:**
        *   **Increased Overall Ride Volume:** Attracts more riders due to lower prices and potentially drivers due to better earnings.
        *   **Improved Fleet Efficiency:** More passengers transported per vehicle mile, making better use of the existing driver network.
        *   **Competitive Differentiation:** Can be a key feature to attract and retain users compared to competitors without robust carpooling.
    *   **For the Community/City:**
        *   **Reduced Traffic Congestion:** Fewer individual cars on the road if carpooling is successful.
        *   **Reduced Emissions & Environmental Impact:** Contributes to sustainability goals.
        *   **Better Utilization of Infrastructure:** More efficient use of road networks.

*   **II. Mission Alignment (e.g., connecting people, building community, sustainable transportation):**
    *   **Connecting People:** Literally brings people together in the same vehicle, potentially fostering brief interactions.
    *   **Building Community (Indirectly):** By making transportation more accessible and affordable, it enables people to participate more in community activities.
    *   **Efficiency & Sustainability:** Directly aligns with missions related to creating more efficient transportation systems and reducing environmental impact.
    *   **Accessibility:** Makes transportation accessible to a wider range of people due to lower costs.

In essence, carpooling can enhance the core ride-sharing offering by making it more affordable, efficient, and environmentally friendly, while also opening up new avenues for growth and positive community impact."

## Question 1.1.2: Tracking Performance

**Interviewer:** "Imagine you launched the Carpool feature. How would you track its performance? What are the key metrics, and how would you slice the data?"

**Candidate Answer (Structured Bullet Points):**

"To track the performance of a new Carpool feature, I'd focus on metrics across adoption, efficiency, economics, and user experience. It's crucial to understand if the feature is meeting the needs of riders, drivers, and the platform.

*   **I. Adoption & Usage Metrics:** (Is it being used?)
    *   **Carpool Ride Penetration:** `(Number of Carpool rides) / (Total number of rides on the platform)`.
        *   *Goal:* See this grow to a significant share.
    *   **Carpool Request Success Rate:** `(Number of successful Carpool matches) / (Number of Carpool requests made)`.
        *   *Goal:* High success rate indicates good matching and availability.
    *   **Active Users Utilizing Carpool:** Number of unique riders and drivers participating in Carpool rides (daily, weekly, monthly).
    *   **New User Acquisition via Carpool:** Percentage of new platform users whose first ride is a Carpool ride (if trackable).

*   **II. Efficiency & Economics Metrics:** (Is it working well and financially viable?)
    *   **Average Fill Rate (Occupancy):** Average number of riders per Carpool vehicle during the carpooled portion of a trip.
        *   *Goal:* Maximize this to improve efficiency.
    *   **Average Detour Time/Distance per Rider:** Additional time or distance added to a rider's trip due to picking up/dropping off other Carpool passengers.
        *   *Goal:* Minimize this to maintain a good rider experience.
    *   **Driver Earnings Impact:**
        *   Average earnings per hour/per mile for drivers on Carpool trips vs. standard trips.
        *   Change in overall driver earnings for those who opt into Carpool.
    *   **Platform Revenue & Margin:**
        *   Revenue per Carpool ride vs. standard ride.
        *   Overall impact on platform take rate and profitability per ride.
    *   **Reduction in Per-Passenger-Mile Cost:** For the platform.

*   **III. User Experience Metrics:** (Are users happy with it?)
    *   **Rider Satisfaction (CSAT/NPS):** Specifically for Carpool rides. Compare with standard ride satisfaction.
        *   *Key Questions:* Are riders satisfied with price, travel time, co-passengers?
    *   **Driver Satisfaction (DSAT/NPS):** Specifically for Carpool trips.
        *   *Key Questions:* Are drivers satisfied with earnings, ease of managing multiple pickups/dropoffs, clarity of instructions?
    *   **Cancellation Rate for Carpool Rides:** By riders or drivers. Compare to standard rides.
        *   *High rates might indicate:* Poor ETAs, long wait times, issues with matching.
    *   **Complaints Related to Carpool:** Track specific categories (e.g., detour too long, uncomfortable co-passenger experience, safety concerns).

*   **IV. Slicing Dimensions for Deeper Insights:**
    *   **Time-Based:** Hour of day, day of week, weekday vs. weekend (to understand peak demand and performance).
    *   **Geographical:** City, specific zones/neighborhoods, route corridors (to identify where Carpool is most/least effective).
    *   **User Segments:**
        *   Riders: New vs. existing users, demographics, price sensitivity, commute vs. leisure trips.
        *   Drivers: Tenure, vehicle type, rating, opt-in frequency for Carpool.
    *   **Ride Characteristics:** Trip distance, time of day, number of matched passengers in a batch.

By monitoring these metrics and slicing them effectively, we can understand the feature's overall health, identify areas for improvement in the matching algorithm, rider/driver experience, and pricing strategy, ensuring Carpool delivers on its value proposition for all parties involved."

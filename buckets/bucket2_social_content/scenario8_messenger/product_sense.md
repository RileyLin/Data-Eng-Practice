# Scenario 8: Messenger (WhatsApp/Telegram) - Product Sense

## Question 8.1.1: Ephemeral Messaging Feature Development

**Interviewer:** "Your team is considering adding an 'ephemeral messaging' (disappearing messages) feature to your existing messaging app, similar to Snapchat or Signal. Walk me through your thought process for designing this feature, including target user benefits, potential risks, and key design considerations."

**Candidate Answer (Structured Bullet Points):**

"Introducing ephemeral messaging can significantly enhance user privacy and encourage more candid conversations. However, it needs careful design to align with user expectations and mitigate potential misuse. Here's my approach:

*   **I. Understanding User Needs & Target Benefits:**

    *   **Primary User Need:** Desire for increased privacy and control over message permanence.
    *   **Target Benefits:**
        *   **Increased Candor:** Users may feel more comfortable sharing sensitive or informal content if they know it won't last forever.
        *   **Reduced Digital Footprint:** Minimizes the amount of personal data stored or accessible long-term.
        *   **Lighter Conversations:** Encourages more spontaneous, in-the-moment interactions without the pressure of creating a permanent record.
        *   **Security for Sensitive Info:** Useful for sharing temporary information like verification codes, addresses, or confidential details (though with caveats about true security).

*   **II. Core Feature Design & User Experience:**

    *   **Activation & Control:**
        *   **Per-Chat Setting:** Allow users to enable/disable ephemeral mode for individual chats (1:1 and group).
        *   **Clear Indication:** Prominent visual cues within the chat interface when ephemeral mode is active (e.g., ghost icon, timer icon, different background color).
        *   **Timer Options:** Offer predefined timer durations (e.g., 5 seconds, 1 minute, 1 hour, 1 day, 7 days) and potentially a custom timer.
        *   **Default State:** Should ephemeral mode be off by default (opt-in) to avoid user confusion? Likely yes.

    *   **Message Lifecycle & Behavior:**
        *   **Disappearance Mechanism:** How do messages disappear? (e.g., deleted from client and server, or just hidden on client with server deletion later).
        *   **Read Receipts Interaction:** Does the timer start when the message is sent, delivered, or read? (Read is usually most intuitive for sender).
        *   **Notifications:** Should notifications also be ephemeral or show a generic "New ephemeral message"?
        *   **Media Handling:** How are photos and videos treated? Do they also disappear? Can they be saved before disappearing (and should this be notified)?

    *   **User Interface Elements:**
        *   **Timer Visibility:** Display a countdown or an icon indicating the message's remaining lifespan.
        *   **Ephemeral Message Styling:** Distinct visual treatment for disappearing messages.
        *   **Settings Accessibility:** Easy access to toggle the mode and adjust timer settings within chat info.

*   **III. Potential Risks & Mitigation Strategies:**

    *   **False Sense of Security:**
        *   *Risk:* Users might believe messages are completely untraceable, leading to risky sharing.
        *   *Mitigation:* Clear disclaimers that recipients can still screenshot or copy messages. Educate users about limitations.

    *   **Screenshot/Copying:**
        *   *Risk:* Undermines the core ephemerality if users can easily save content.
        *   *Mitigation:* Consider screenshot notifications (though these can be bypassed). Focus on setting expectations rather than foolproof prevention.

    *   **Harassment & Abuse:**
        *   *Risk:* Ephemeral messages could be used for bullying or sharing inappropriate content with less traceability.
        *   *Mitigation:* Maintain robust reporting mechanisms. Even if the message disappears for users, a temporary server-side log (subject to privacy policy and legal requirements) might be needed for investigations. Ensure user blocking works effectively.

    *   **User Confusion & Accidental Usage:**
        *   *Risk:* Users might enable it accidentally or not understand its implications.
        *   *Mitigation:* Clear onboarding for the feature. Require explicit confirmation when enabling for the first time in a chat.

    *   **Group Chat Complexity:**
        *   *Risk:* Who controls the ephemeral settings in a group chat? What if participants have different preferences?
        *   *Mitigation:* Define clear rules (e.g., admin control, or if any member can turn it on/off for their view, or if it's a group-wide setting by admin).

*   **IV. Key Design Decisions & Trade-offs:**

    *   **Security vs. Usability:** Stricter security (e.g., blocking screenshots) might degrade user experience.
    *   **Simplicity vs. Granularity:** Offering too many timer options could be confusing.
    *   **Notification Privacy:** Full content in notifications vs. generic alerts.
    *   **Server-Side Deletion Policy:** How long, if at all, are messages retained on servers for recovery or investigation purposes, balancing privacy with safety.

*   **V. Rollout & Success Metrics:**

    *   **Phased Rollout:** Start with a beta group or specific markets to gather feedback.
    *   **Key Metrics:**
        *   **Adoption Rate:** Percentage of active users trying the feature; percentage of chats where it's enabled.
        *   **Engagement Shift:** Changes in message volume, session length in chats with ephemeral mode on.
        *   **User Satisfaction (CSAT/NPS):** Surveys about the feature's usefulness and ease of use.
        *   **Timer Duration Preferences:** Which timer settings are most popular?
        *   **Impact on Reporting/Blocking:** Any increase/decrease in harassment reports in ephemeral chats.
        *   **Screenshot Notification Impact (if implemented):** Does it deter saving, or just annoy users?

By carefully considering these aspects, we can design an ephemeral messaging feature that provides tangible user benefits while proactively addressing potential downsides."

## Question 8.1.2: Metrics for Message Reactions Feature

**Interviewer:** "Your messaging app has just launched message reactions (e.g., like, love, laugh emojis on individual messages). What key metrics would you track to measure its success and identify areas for improvement?"

**Candidate Answer (Structured Bullet Points):**

"Message reactions are designed to increase engagement, provide quick feedback, and add emotional expression to chats. A comprehensive metrics framework is needed to assess their impact effectively.

*   **I. Adoption & Usage Metrics:**

    *   **Feature Discovery & Activation:**
        *   **Reaction Menu Impression Rate:** Percentage of users who see the reaction options (e.g., long-press on a message).
        *   **First-Time Reaction Usage:** Percentage of active users who use a reaction at least once.
        *   **Weekly/Monthly Active Reaction Users:** Number/percentage of users using reactions regularly.

    *   **Usage Frequency & Depth:**
        *   **Reactions per User per Day/Week:** Average number of reactions sent by active reaction users.
        *   **Reactions per Message:** Average number of reactions a message receives (overall and for messages that get at least one reaction).
        *   **Percentage of Messages Receiving Reactions:** What proportion of overall messages get any reaction?
        *   **Reaction Diversity:** Distribution of different reaction types used (e.g., like, love, laugh, sad, angry). Are users using the full range or just one or two?
        *   **Unique Reactors per Message:** Average number of distinct users reacting to a single message in group chats.

*   **II. Engagement & Interaction Impact:**

    *   **Chat Activity Changes:**
        *   **Impact on Text Reply Volume:** Do reactions replace short text replies (e.g., "ok", "lol")? Is this seen as positive (efficiency) or negative (less personal)?
        *   **Session Length/Messages per Session:** Does using reactions correlate with longer or more active chat sessions?
        *   **Notification Engagement:** Do users open notifications for reactions? Are reaction notifications considered valuable or noisy?

    *   **Conversation Quality (Qualitative Proxies):**
        *   **Reduction in Unanswered Messages:** Do reactions serve as acknowledgments, reducing the feeling of being ignored?
        *   **User Sentiment in Chats with Reactions:** (Advanced) NLP analysis on subsequent messages to see if reactions correlate with more positive conversation tones.

*   **III. User Experience & Satisfaction:**

    *   **Ease of Use:**
        *   **Time to React:** How quickly can users select and apply a reaction?
        *   **Misclick/Correction Rate:** How often are reactions changed or removed shortly after being applied?

    *   **Perceived Value (Surveys & Feedback):**
        *   **CSAT/NPS for the reactions feature.**
        *   Qualitative feedback on: "How much do you like the reactions feature?", "Does it improve your chat experience?", "Are there any reactions you wish we had?"
        *   **Usefulness in Group Chats vs. 1:1 Chats:** Segment feedback by chat type.

    *   **Notification Overload:**
        *   **Reaction Notification Mute/Disable Rate:** How often are users customizing or turning off reaction notifications?
        *   Complaints about notification volume related to reactions.

*   **IV. Feature Iteration & Improvement Insights:**

    *   **Popularity of Specific Reactions:** Identify the most and least used reaction emojis. Could inform future emoji set updates.
    *   **Contextual Usage Patterns:** Are certain reactions used more frequently in response to specific message types (e.g., questions, images, links)?
    *   **Requests for New Reactions:** Monitor social media and feedback channels for desired additions.
    *   **Impact of UI Changes:** If the way to react is updated, track changes in adoption and usage metrics.

*   **V. Potential Negative Impacts & Guardrail Metrics:**
    *   **Misinterpretation/Ambiguity:** Track if certain reactions are consistently leading to confusion (difficult to measure directly, might rely on qualitative feedback or specific user reports).
    *   **Passive Engagement:** Ensure reactions aren't overly cannibalizing more active forms of engagement like text replies if that's a concern for platform depth.
    *   **Performance:** Ensure the feature is responsive and doesn't slow down the app, especially in large group chats with many reactions.

By monitoring these metrics, we can understand how users are interacting with message reactions, whether the feature is meeting its goals of enhancing communication, and how to evolve it further."

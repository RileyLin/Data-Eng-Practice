## Question 7.1.2: Metrics for a New 'AI Enhance' Feature

**Interviewer:** "Suppose Instagram launches a new 'AI Enhance' button that automatically improves photos with one tap. What metrics would you track to determine its success and identify areas for improvement?"

**Candidate Answer (Structured Bullet Points):**

"The success of an 'AI Enhance' feature hinges on its ability to deliver genuinely improved photos that users appreciate and trust. The metrics framework should cover adoption, perceived quality, impact on overall posting behavior, and potential negative consequences.

*   **I. Adoption & Usage Metrics:**

    *   **Feature Discovery Rate:** Percentage of users who see/are exposed to the 'AI Enhance' button.
    *   **First-Time Usage Rate:** Percentage of users who try the feature at least once.
    *   **Adoption Rate:** Percentage of active uploaders who use 'AI Enhance' regularly (e.g., in >X% of their uploads).
    *   **Frequency of Use:** Average number of times 'AI Enhance' is applied per user session or per week.
    *   **Entry Points:** Which pathways lead to using 'AI Enhance' (e.g., directly in camera, from gallery selection, during editing flow).

*   **II. Perceived Quality & User Satisfaction:**

    *   **Keep Rate / Acceptance Rate:** Percentage of times users keep the AI-enhanced version versus reverting or further editing it manually.
        *   *Drill-down:* Analyze by photo category (portrait, landscape, food, low-light etc.) to see where AI performs best/worst.
    *   **Manual Adjustment Post-Enhance:** Percentage of users who apply 'AI Enhance' and then make further manual edits. High rates might indicate the enhancement isn't quite right.
    *   **A/B Test Performance:** Compare engagement (likes, comments, views) on posts using 'AI Enhance' vs. manually edited vs. unedited (control group).
    *   **Direct User Feedback/Surveys:**
        *   Satisfaction scores (e.g., 1-5 stars) specifically for the enhanced photo.
        *   Qualitative feedback: "What did you like/dislike about the enhancement?"
        *   Comparison tests: Show users original vs. enhanced, ask which they prefer and why.
    *   **'Undo' Rate:** How often users apply 'AI Enhance' and then immediately undo it.

*   **III. Impact on Posting Behavior & Content Quality:**

    *   **Time to Post:** Does 'AI Enhance' speed up the overall editing and posting process?
    *   **Overall Photo Quality on Platform:** (Harder to measure directly) Can be proxied by looking at average engagement on photos using AI Enhance, or through human review panels assessing a sample of enhanced photos.
    *   **Increase in Posting Frequency:** Do users who adopt 'AI Enhance' post more often, suggesting it lowers the barrier to sharing?
    *   **Shift in Editing Tool Usage:** Decrease in manual use of specific tools (e.g., brightness, contrast) if AI handles them well, or increase if AI provides a good starting point.
    *   **Use on Low-Quality Originals:** Is the feature primarily used to salvage poor photos or to further polish good ones?

*   **IV. Technical Performance & Reliability:**

    *   **Processing Time:** Average time taken for the AI enhancement to apply.
    *   **Error Rate:** Percentage of times the enhancement process fails or produces undesirable artifacts.
    *   **Crash Rate:** Does the feature cause any app instability?
    *   **Resource Consumption:** Impact on battery life and data usage (if server-side processing is involved and previews are downloaded).

*   **V. Potential Negative Consequences & Guardrail Metrics:**

    *   **Over-Editing/Unnatural Look:** Track feedback related to photos looking 'too processed' or 'fake'.
    *   **Bias Detection:** Ensure the AI enhancement works equally well across different skin tones, lighting conditions, and subject matters. Track performance disparities across user segments or image types.
    *   **Reduction in Creative Control Satisfaction:** Are users feeling like they have less control if they rely too much on AI? (Monitor if usage of manual tools drops *too* significantly alongside complaints).
    *   **Homogenization of Content:** Does widespread use lead to a 'sameness' in photo aesthetics on the platform? (Monitor visual diversity of popular posts).

*   **VI. Iteration & Improvement Metrics:**

    *   **Effectiveness by Photo Category:** Identify which types of photos (portraits, landscapes, low-light, etc.) the AI excels or struggles with.
    *   **Intensity Adjustment Usage:** If an intensity slider is provided for the AI effect, how often is it used and what are the common adjustments?
    *   **Feedback Loop Effectiveness:** Track how user reports or 'undo' actions on specific enhancements correlate with subsequent model improvements.

By tracking this comprehensive set of metrics, we can understand the holistic impact of the 'AI Enhance' feature, iterate effectively, and ensure it genuinely adds value for users while aligning with platform goals."
